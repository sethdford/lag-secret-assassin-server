# LAG Secret Assassin - Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the LAG Secret Assassin platform, focusing on performance improvements, code quality enhancements, and architectural refinements.

## Key Findings

### 1. File Size Analysis
The following files exceed the 500-line threshold and require modularization:

| File | Lines | Priority | Complexity |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| ProximityDetectionService.java | 1838 | CRITICAL | High - Core game mechanic |
| GameFlowEndToEndTest.java | 1458 | LOW | Test file - can be split |
| AntiCheatService.java | 1078 | HIGH | Security critical |
| SafeZoneService.java | 1042 | HIGH | Core game mechanic |
| ProximityDetectionServiceSafeZoneIntegrationTest.java | 915 | LOW | Test file |
| MapConfigurationServiceTest.java | 842 | LOW | Test file |
| KillService.java | 833 | HIGH | Core game mechanic |
| GameSimulation.java | 806 | MEDIUM | Simulation tool |

### 2. Performance Optimization Opportunities

#### Lambda Configuration
- All Lambda functions use 512MB memory (except one with 1024MB)
- Opportunity to right-size based on actual usage patterns
- Consider implementing Lambda Power Tuning

#### Database Optimization
- DynamoDB tables use PAY_PER_REQUEST billing
- Consider provisioned capacity for predictable workloads
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data

#### Code-Level Optimizations
- ProximityDetectionService has caching but could benefit from better algorithm optimization
- Location history tracking could be moved to DynamoDB Streams processing
- WebSocket message broadcasting could be optimized with batch operations

## Refactoring Priorities

### Priority 1: Critical Service Refactoring (Week 1)

#### 1.1 ProximityDetectionService Decomposition
Break down the 1838-line service into:
- `ProximityCalculator` - Core distance calculations
- `LocationHistoryManager` - Location tracking and smoothing (already partially implemented)
- `ProximityAlertService` - Alert generation and management
- `ProximityCacheManager` - Caching logic
- `LocationValidator` - GPS accuracy and staleness checks

#### 1.2 AntiCheatService Modularization
Split the 1078-line service into:
- `CheatDetectionEngine` - Core detection algorithms
- `BehaviorAnalyzer` - Player behavior patterns
- `ViolationHandler` - Violation processing and penalties
- `SecurityEventLogger` - Audit and logging

#### 1.3 SafeZoneService Restructuring
Divide the 1042-line service into:
- `SafeZoneValidator` - Zone boundary checks
- `SafeZoneScheduler` - Time-based zone management
- `SafeZoneEventHandler` - Entry/exit events
- `SafeZoneRepository` - Data access abstraction

### Priority 2: Core Service Optimization (Week 2)

#### 2.1 KillService Enhancement
- Extract verification logic to `KillVerificationService`
- Create `KillWorkflow` for state management
- Implement `KillNotificationService` for alerts

#### 2.2 Performance Optimizations
- Implement Redis caching for hot data paths
- Add connection pooling for external services
- Optimize DynamoDB query patterns

#### 2.3 Lambda Right-Sizing
- Profile actual memory usage
- Implement AWS Lambda Power Tuning
- Adjust memory allocations based on data

### Priority 3: Architecture Improvements (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Event-Driven Architecture Enhancement
- Implement EventBridge for decoupled event processing
- Move heavy processing to asynchronous workflows
- Add SQS for reliable message processing

#### 3.2 Caching Strategy
- Implement Redis/ElastiCache for:
  - Player location caching
  - Game state caching
  - Safe zone boundaries
  - Active target assignments

#### 3.3 Database Optimization
- Analyze access patterns and optimize GSIs
- Implement DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for microsecond latency
- Consider read replicas for heavy read operations

### Priority 4: Testing and Quality (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Test Suite Modularization
- Split large test files into focused test suites
- Implement test categorization (unit, integration, e2e)
- Add performance benchmarks

#### 4.2 Code Quality Improvements
- Implement SonarQube for continuous code quality
- Add mutation testing for better test coverage
- Establish code review guidelines

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
1. Set up feature branches for each refactoring task
2. Create interfaces for new service components
3. Implement dependency injection framework enhancements

### Phase 2: Service Decomposition (Days 4-10)

3. Refactor SafeZoneService
4. Update all dependent services

### Phase 3: Performance Implementation (Days 11-15)
1. Implement caching layer
2. Optimize Lambda configurations
3. Add performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Days 16-20)
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Perform load testing
3. Validate performance improvements
4. Document changes
