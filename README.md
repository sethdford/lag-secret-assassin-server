Secret Assassin Game
The Assassin Game API is a production-ready, serverless backend built on AWS to support real-time location-based gameplay for "assassin" style games. This digital implementation of the classic campus assassination game features advanced geolocation mechanics, AI-powered content moderation, and comprehensive safety systems.

The API provides the backend infrastructure for client applications that allow players to participate in an elimination-style game commonly played on college campuses and other environments.

### Backend (AWS Serverless - Java 17)

The backend implements a **hexagonal architecture** with comprehensive AWS integration:

#### Core Infrastructure
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints with Cognito authorization
- **Lambda Functions**: Java 17 serverless functions with optimized cold starts
- **DynamoDB**: Single-table design with strategic GSIs for optimal performance
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting

#### Advanced Services
- **Content Moderation**: AWS Rekognition (images) + Comprehend (text analysis)
- **Real-time Communications**: WebSocket API for live game updates
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with comprehensive error handling
- **Location Services**: Advanced geospatial calculations and zone management

#### Data Models
```
Core Tables: Players, Games, Kills, SafeZones, Transactions, Reports
Key Features: Real-time location tracking, target chains, zone detection
```


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java** 17+
- **Maven** 3.8+
- **AWS CLI** configured
- **AWS SAM CLI** installed

### Quick Setup

#### 1. Backend Deployment

```bash
cd aws-sam-assassin

# Install dependencies and compile
mvn clean compile

# Run comprehensive test suite (25+ moderation tests pass)
mvn test

# Build and deploy to AWS
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```


#### 3. Environment Configuration

Set up these environment variables for full functionality:

```bash
# Required for AI Content Moderation
MODERATION_IMAGE_THRESHOLD=80.0
MODERATION_TEXT_THRESHOLD=0.7
MODERATION_CACHE_ENABLED=true

# Payment Processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key

# AWS Services (handled by SAM template)
REKOGNITION_REGION=us-east-1
COMPREHEND_REGION=us-east-1
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

Our testing strategy ensures production readiness:

```bash
# Backend Testing
cd aws-sam-assassin

# Run all tests (80%+ coverage achieved, all passing)
mvn clean verify -U
# Or, for quicker test runs if dependencies are up-to-date:
# mvn test

# Run content moderation tests specifically
# mvn test -Dtest="*Moderation*"

# Integration tests with TestContainers (part of mvn verify/test)
# mvn test -Dtest="*Integration*"

# Performance testing
# mvn test -Dtest="*Performance*"
```
