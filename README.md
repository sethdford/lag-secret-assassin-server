## Overview

The Assassin Game is a modern implementation of the classic campus game where players are assigned targets to "assassinate" (tag) while avoiding being tagged themselves. This digital version uses geolocation, real-time notifications, secure authentication, and advanced content moderation to create an engaging and fair gameplay experience.

## üéØ Features

### Core Gameplay
* **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system using Amazon Cognito
* **Real-time Location Tracking**: Report kills with geolocation verification
* **Target Assignment System**: Dynamic target assignment with safe zone protection
* **Kill Verification**: Photo-based proof system with AI content moderation

### Safety & Moderation
* **Content Moderation**: AWS Rekognition and Comprehend integration for automatic content filtering
* **Emergency Controls**: Game pause functionality for safety situations
* **Reporting System**: Comprehensive reporting tools for inappropriate behavior
* **Safe Zones**: Configurable areas where eliminations are not allowed

### Management & Analytics
* **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive game management tools for organizers
* **Player Statistics**: Detailed performance metrics and leaderboards
* **Real-time Updates**: Live kill feed and game state notifications
* **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration for entry fees and premium features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (AWS Serverless)

The backend is built using AWS Serverless architecture with Java 17:

* **API Gateway**: REST API endpoints for game operations
* **Lambda Functions**: Java-based serverless functions for business logic
* **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing game state and player data
* **Cognito**: User authentication and authorization
* **Rekognition**: AI-powered image content moderation
* **Comprehend**: AI-powered text analysis and toxicity detection
* **CloudWatch**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting
* **S3**: Static file storage for user uploads

### Frontend

The frontend is built with modern web technologies:

* **Next.js**: React framework for the web application
* **TypeScript**: Type-safe code development
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
* **SWR**: Data fetching and caching
* **Jest/React Testing Library**: Component testing
* **Cypress**: End-to-end testing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* Java 17+
* Maven 3.8+
* AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
* AWS SAM CLI

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the AWS SAM directory:**
   ```bash
   cd aws-sam-assassin
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and compile:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Build the SAM application:**
   ```bash
   sam build
   ```

5. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

6. **Note the API endpoint URL** for frontend configuration.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the web directory:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Update `.env.local` with your API endpoint and other configuration.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application** at `http://localhost:3000`

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing

Our backend has comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and moderation system tests:

```bash
cd aws-sam-assassin

mvn test -Dtest="*Moderation*"

# Build without tests
mvn package -DskipTests
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd web

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run Cypress E2E tests
npm run cypress
```
