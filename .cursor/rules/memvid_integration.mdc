# Memvid Knowledge Base Integration

## Purpose
This rule enables Cursor to access the project's Memvid knowledge base for context and clarity instead of making assumptions.

## When to Use Memvid

### Always Use Before:
- Making assumptions about project architecture
- Implementing new features without context
- Writing tests without understanding patterns
- Making technical decisions
- Suggesting code changes

### Search Queries Examples:
- "How does the shrinking zone work?"
- "What are the testing patterns used?"
- "What is the DynamoDB schema?"
- "How is authentication implemented?"
- "What are the subscription tiers?"

## Integration Commands

Use these Python commands to query the knowledge base:

```python
# Search for specific information
from cursor_memvid_integration import CursorMemvidClient
client = CursorMemvidClient()

# Check if server is available
if client.is_server_available():
    # Search for information
    response = client.search_knowledge("your query here")
    
    # Ask comprehensive questions
    answer = client.ask_question("How should I implement feature X?")
    print(answer)
else:
    print("Start Memvid server: python3 memvid_integration.py --start-server")
```

## Best Practices

- **Search First**: Always search before making assumptions
- **Be Specific**: Use specific queries for better results
- **Verify Information**: Cross-reference with multiple sources
- **Update Knowledge**: Suggest updates when information is outdated

Remember: **Always prefer Memvid knowledge over assumptions!**
