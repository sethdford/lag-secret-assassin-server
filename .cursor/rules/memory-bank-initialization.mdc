# Memory Bank Initialization for Cursor Custom Modes

## Critical Rules

- **Always check for .memory/ directory existence** before proceeding with any memory bank operations
- **Create complete directory structure** if .memory/ doesn't exist:
  - .memory/40-active.md (Active Context)
  - .memory/10-product.md (Product Context) 
  - .memory/50-progress.md (Progress Tracking)
  - .memory/50-decisions.md (Decision Log)
  - .memory/50-patterns.md (System Patterns)
- **Initialize with proper file templates** including frontmatter and basic structure
- **Maintain consistent timestamp format** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] for all updates
- **Status indicators** must be used in all Memory Bank custom modes:
  - '[MEMORY BANK: ARCHITECT]' for architect mode
  - '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' for code mode when files exist
  - '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' for code mode when files don't exist
  - '[MEMORY BANK: DEBUG]' for debug mode
  - '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]' for update mode

## Examples

<example>
**Memory Bank Architect Mode Initialization:**
```
[MEMORY BANK: ARCHITECT]

I've detected that no .memory/ directory exists. Let me initialize the Memory Bank system for this project.

Creating .memory/ directory structure...
âœ“ .memory/40-active.md
âœ“ .memory/10-product.md  
âœ“ .memory/50-progress.md
âœ“ .memory/50-decisions.md
âœ“ .memory/50-patterns.md

Memory Bank initialized successfully. You can now switch to other Memory Bank modes for development work.
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
**Incorrect - Missing status indicator:**
```
I see you want to initialize the memory bank. Let me create the files...
(Missing '[MEMORY BANK: ARCHITECT]' status indicator)
```
</example>
