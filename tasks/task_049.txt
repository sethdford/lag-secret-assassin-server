# Task ID: 49
# Title: Configure S3 for Media Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Amazon S3 buckets with appropriate configurations to handle user-uploaded media including profile pictures and elimination verification photos.
# Details:
1. Create two separate S3 buckets: one for profile pictures and one for elimination verification photos.
2. Configure bucket policies with least privilege principles, allowing only authenticated users to access their own media.
3. Implement CORS settings to allow uploads from the application domain.
4. Set up lifecycle policies to manage storage costs (consider moving older verification photos to Glacier after 30 days).
5. Implement server-side encryption for all stored media.
6. Create a service layer in the application that generates pre-signed URLs with limited validity (15 minutes) for secure client-side uploads.
7. Implement file validation to ensure only images of appropriate size (max 5MB) and type (jpg, png) are uploaded.
8. Set up CloudFront distribution for efficient content delivery of profile pictures.
9. Implement proper error handling for failed uploads with meaningful user feedback.
10. Create a cleanup mechanism to remove orphaned media files when user profiles are deleted.
11. Document the S3 bucket structure and access patterns for the team.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the pre-signed URL generation service with various file types and sizes.
2. Verify direct uploads using pre-signed URLs work from both web and mobile clients.
3. Test file type and size validation by attempting to upload invalid files.
4. Verify that users can only access their own media files and not others'.
5. Test the CloudFront distribution by measuring load times from different geographic locations.
6. Verify lifecycle policies by checking that older files are correctly transitioned to different storage classes.
7. Test error scenarios: network interruptions during upload, invalid file types, oversized files.
8. Perform security testing to ensure URLs cannot be manipulated to access unauthorized content.
9. Verify that when a user is deleted, their associated media is properly removed.
10. Load test the system with concurrent uploads to ensure performance under load.
11. Verify that the S3 bucket logging is properly configured for audit purposes.
