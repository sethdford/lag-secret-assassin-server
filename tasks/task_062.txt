# Task ID: 62
# Title: Analyze and Reconcile Safe Zone Task Overlap
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review Task 12 ('Implement Safe Zone Management') and Task 28 ('Implement Comprehensive Safe Zone System') to determine their relationship and eliminate redundancy or clarify distinct objectives.
# Details:
This task requires a detailed analysis of both Task 12 and Task 28 to determine their relationship and resolve any potential overlap or confusion. The developer should:

1. Review the complete documentation, implementation details, and acceptance criteria for Task 12 (completed)
2. Review the planned scope, requirements, and objectives for Task 28
3. Create a comparison document that clearly outlines:
   - Features implemented in Task 12
   - Features planned for Task 28
   - Areas of potential overlap
   - Unique aspects of Task 28 that justify its existence
4. Consult with relevant stakeholders (product owner, project manager, etc.) to clarify the original intent of both tasks
5. Based on findings, prepare one of the following recommendations:
   - Mark Task 28 as a duplicate and close it
   - Redefine Task 28 to focus only on extending/enhancing the existing safe zone system with specific new features
   - Split Task 28 into multiple distinct tasks that clearly define new functionality
6. Update the Task 28 description with clear, unambiguous language that distinguishes it from Task 12
7. Document the decision-making process and rationale for future reference

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task should be verified through the following methods:

1. Documentation Review:
   - Verify that a comprehensive comparison document exists detailing the scope of both tasks
   - Confirm that stakeholder input has been documented
   - Ensure the decision-making process is clearly articulated

2. Task Definition Quality Check:
   - If Task 28 is kept, its updated description should pass a peer review confirming it has:
     * Clear, measurable objectives distinct from Task 12
     * No ambiguous language that could cause confusion
     * Specific acceptance criteria that don't overlap with Task 12

3. Stakeholder Validation:
   - Product owner or project manager should formally approve the resolution
   - Development team members should confirm they understand the distinction between tasks

4. Project Management System Update:
   - Verify that Task 28's status, description, or existence in the system accurately reflects the decision made
   - Ensure any dependencies are appropriately updated
