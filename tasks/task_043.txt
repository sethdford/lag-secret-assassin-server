# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement Shrinking Safe Zone Gameplay Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a new gameplay mode where the safe playable area gradually shrinks over time, damaging players who remain outside the boundaries.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive system for the shrinking safe zone gameplay mode with the following components:

1. Zone Configuration System:
   - Define a configurable set of shrinking stages (minimum 3-5 stages)
   - For each stage, specify: duration, final zone size, transition time, and damage amount
   - Create a visual indicator for the current safe zone and the next zone boundary

2. Zone State Management:
   - Implement a state machine to handle zone transitions (Waiting, Shrinking, Stable)
   - Create a timer system to manage stage progression
   - Develop smooth interpolation for zone shrinking animations
   - Ensure the zone center can be randomized or predetermined

3. Player Damage System:
   - Implement a system to detect players outside the safe zone
   - Apply configurable damage over time to players outside the zone
   - Add visual and audio feedback when players take zone damage
   - Include a grace period when a new zone is announced before damage begins

4. Game Integration:
   - Add the new mode to the game mode selection UI
   - Implement proper initialization and cleanup for the mode
   - Create appropriate UI elements showing zone timer, current stage, and warning indicators
   - Ensure the mode works with existing game systems (respawn, scoring, etc.)

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize zone boundary calculations to minimize performance impact
   - Use efficient player position checking methods
   - Consider level of detail adjustments for zone visualization at distance

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the shrinking safe zone gameplay mode:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify zone shrinks correctly according to configured parameters
   - Confirm damage is applied at the correct rate to players outside the zone
   - Test zone state transitions occur at the expected times
   - Validate visual indicators accurately represent current and next zone boundaries

2. Edge Cases:
   - Test behavior when players are exactly on the zone boundary
   - Verify correct behavior when players rapidly enter and exit the zone
   - Test with minimum and maximum configured zone sizes
   - Validate behavior when all players are outside the zone

3. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the mode works correctly with different maps and player counts
   - Test interaction with other game systems (scoring, respawn, etc.)
   - Confirm UI elements update correctly as the zone changes

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure frame rate impact with maximum player count
   - Profile memory usage during extended gameplay sessions
   - Test on minimum specification hardware to ensure acceptable performance

5. Playtest Scenarios:
   - Organize playtests with different zone configurations
   - Gather feedback on pacing, difficulty, and fun factor
   - Verify the mode creates the intended tension and strategic gameplay
