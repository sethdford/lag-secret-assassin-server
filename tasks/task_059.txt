# Task ID: 59
# Title: Document and Implement Authorization Logic for 'createdBy' Field in SafeZoneHandler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review, document, and implement proper authorization logic for the 'createdBy' field during safe zone creation across different zone types, ensuring security compliance with CognitoAuthorizer.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive review of the current implementation of the 'createdBy' field in the SafeZoneHandler and documenting the intended authorization logic. The developer should:

1. Review the current implementation of safe zone creation for all zone types (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, TIMED, RELOCATABLE)
2. Document who should be authorized to set the 'createdBy' field for each zone type
3. Analyze potential security vulnerabilities in the current implementation, especially focusing on:
   - Whether users can impersonate others by setting 'createdBy' to another user's ID
   - How the CognitoAuthorizer validates the requesting user's identity
   - If there are any bypass mechanisms in the current implementation
4. Create a detailed authorization matrix that specifies:
   - For each zone type, who can create zones
   - Who can set the 'createdBy' field and under what circumstances
   - What validation checks should be performed
5. Implement necessary changes to ensure:
   - The 'createdBy' field is always set to the authenticated user's ID from Cognito for user-created zones
   - For system-created zones (if applicable), implement proper validation
   - Add appropriate error handling for unauthorized attempts to set 'createdBy'
6. Update API documentation to clearly indicate the authorization requirements

The implementation should ensure that the 'createdBy' field cannot be manipulated by users to claim ownership of zones they didn't create, while maintaining the functionality required for each zone type.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the security and functionality aspects of the implementation:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test each zone type creation with various 'createdBy' scenarios
   - Verify that attempts to set 'createdBy' to a different user ID than the authenticated user are rejected
   - Test error handling for unauthorized attempts

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create test cases that simulate API calls with different Cognito authentication contexts
   - Verify that the 'createdBy' field is correctly set to the authenticated user's ID
   - Test zone creation for each zone type with valid authentication

3. Security Tests:
   - Attempt to bypass authentication by manipulating request parameters
   - Test with expired or invalid Cognito tokens
   - Verify that the CognitoAuthorizer correctly validates user identity before allowing zone creation

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test behavior when the Cognito user information is incomplete
   - Test with users having different permission levels
   - Test system-created zones (if applicable) to ensure proper validation

5. Documentation Verification:
   - Review the created authorization matrix against the implemented code
   - Ensure API documentation accurately reflects the implemented authorization logic

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing compliance with the security requirements.
