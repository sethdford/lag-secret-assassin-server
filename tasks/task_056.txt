# Task ID: 56
# Title: Implement Unified Smoothing Algorithm Framework for Safe Zone Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a unified framework for location smoothing algorithms that ensures consistent behavior between general location tracking and safe zone detection, with configurable parameters and comprehensive testing.
# Details:
Create a refactored architecture for the LocationHistoryManager that separates smoothing algorithm implementations while maintaining consistent behavior:

1. Implement an abstract SmoothingAlgorithm interface with concrete implementations for each algorithm type (LINEAR_WEIGHTED, EXPONENTIAL_DECAY, SIMPLE_AVERAGE, PREDICTIVE)
2. Add algorithm-specific configuration parameters for each implementation, including:
   - Window size/time period for samples
   - Weighting factors
   - Decay rates for exponential algorithms
   - Prediction confidence thresholds
3. Modify the LocationHistoryManager to allow separate algorithm selection for:
   - General location smoothing (UI display, movement tracking)
   - Safe zone detection and interaction
4. Implement a configuration system that allows runtime switching between algorithms
5. Create a SmoothingVisualizer class that can render:
   - Raw location points
   - Smoothed paths for each algorithm type
   - Safe zone boundaries and interaction points
   - Visual indicators for algorithm-specific parameters
6. Document each algorithm's strengths, weaknesses, and recommended use cases in both code comments and external documentation
7. Identify and handle edge cases where algorithms might produce inconsistent results, such as:
   - Rapid direction changes
   - GPS signal loss/recovery
   - High-frequency but low-magnitude jitter
   - Device-specific sampling rate variations

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and the gameplay experience:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create test fixtures with predefined location data sets representing different movement patterns
   - Verify each algorithm produces expected output for known input sequences
   - Test edge cases: stationary positions, straight-line movement, erratic movement, GPS jumps
   - Verify configuration changes correctly affect algorithm behavior

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test that safe zone detection works consistently across all algorithms
   - Verify that algorithm switching doesn't cause unexpected behavior changes
   - Test performance impact of each algorithm under various load conditions

3. Visual Verification:
   - Use the visualization tools to manually verify smoothing behavior
   - Record and replay real-world movement patterns to verify algorithm behavior
   - Compare algorithm outputs side-by-side for the same input data

4. Gameplay Testing:
   - Create test scenarios that specifically target safe zone interactions
   - Verify that player experience is consistent regardless of selected algorithm
   - Test on multiple device types to ensure consistent behavior across hardware

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
