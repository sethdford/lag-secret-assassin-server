# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Websocket Support for Real-time Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement websocket connections to enable real-time game state updates including player positions, kill notifications, and zone changes as specified in IR-1.2.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a WebSocket server and client architecture to provide real-time updates to players in the game. The implementation should:

1. Set up a WebSocket server endpoint that can handle multiple concurrent connections
2. Create client-side WebSocket connection management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
3. Implement message serialization/deserialization for efficient data transfer
4. Handle three specific types of real-time updates:
   - Player position updates (high frequency, optimized for minimal bandwidth)
   - Kill notifications (event-based)
   - Zone changes/updates (event-based)
5. Implement proper error handling and connection recovery
6. Add security measures to authenticate WebSocket connections
7. Ensure the WebSocket implementation works with the existing geolocation system (Task 6)
8. Integrate with the notification system (Task 14) to ensure notifications can be delivered in real-time
9. Implement throttling mechanisms to prevent server overload
10. Add logging for connection events and message traffic for debugging

The implementation should use a standard WebSocket library compatible with the project's tech stack and follow the protocol specifications in requirements.md (IR-1.2).

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functional correctness and performance characteristics:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test WebSocket connection establishment and maintenance
   - Test message serialization/deserialization
   - Test handling of each update type (player positions, kills, zone changes)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify WebSocket integration with geolocation system
   - Verify WebSocket integration with notification system
   - Test authentication and security measures

3. Performance Tests:
   - Measure latency of updates under various network conditions
   - Test with simulated load of 100+ concurrent connections
   - Verify bandwidth usage is within acceptable limits

4. Specific Test Cases:
   - Verify player position updates are received within 200ms of movement
   - Confirm kill notifications appear immediately for all relevant players
   - Test zone change propagation to all affected players
   - Verify reconnection works properly after network interruption
   - Test behavior when server is restarted

5. Manual Testing:
   - Use browser dev tools to monitor WebSocket traffic
   - Verify visual indicators update correctly in real-time
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers
