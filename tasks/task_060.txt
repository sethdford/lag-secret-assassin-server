# Title: Enhance Error Handling for Unparsable lastRelocationTime in SafeZoneService.relocateZone
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Improve the error handling mechanism in SafeZoneService.relocateZone method when encountering unparsable 'lastRelocationTime' values, and implement a consistent policy for handling this scenario.
# Details:
The current implementation of SafeZoneService.relocateZone has inadequate error handling when it encounters an unparsable 'lastRelocationTime' value. This task requires:

1. Review the current implementation to understand how lastRelocationTime is used in the relocation cooldown logic
2. Make a design decision on the appropriate behavior when lastRelocationTime cannot be parsed:
   - Option A: Block the relocation (treating it as if the cooldown is still active)
   - Option B: Allow the relocation (treating it as if the cooldown has expired)
   - Option C: Reset the cooldown timestamp to the current time
3. Implement the chosen approach with proper error handling:
   - Add try-catch blocks around the parsing of lastRelocationTime
   - Log appropriate error messages with context information
   - Consider adding telemetry to track frequency of this error
4. Update the method documentation to clearly describe the behavior when lastRelocationTime is unparsable
5. Ensure the implementation is consistent with other error handling patterns in the codebase
6. Consider adding validation for lastRelocationTime before attempting to parse it (e.g., check if it's null, empty, or in an obviously invalid format)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create test cases with various invalid lastRelocationTime values (null, empty string, malformed date string, invalid format)
   - Verify the method behaves according to the chosen design decision for each case
   - Test that appropriate error messages are logged
   - Ensure the method doesn't throw uncaught exceptions

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the end-to-end flow with invalid lastRelocationTime values
   - Verify that the system remains stable and continues to function
   - Check that error logs contain sufficient information for debugging

3. Manual Testing:
   - Deliberately inject invalid lastRelocationTime values in a test environment
   - Verify the application behavior matches expectations
   - Confirm error messages are clear and actionable

4. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that valid lastRelocationTime values are still processed correctly
   - Verify that the cooldown functionality works as expected in normal scenarios
