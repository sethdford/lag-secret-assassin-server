# Task ID: 63
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite for Safe Zone Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for the Safe Zone feature components to ensure functionality, validation, and error handling work as expected.
# Details:
Create test classes for SafeZone.java, SafeZoneDao.java, SafeZoneService.java, and SafeZoneHandler.java that thoroughly test all aspects of the Safe Zone functionality. Tests should cover:

1. **SafeZone.java**:
   - Test all constructors and builder patterns
   - Validate getter/setter methods
   - Test equality and hash code implementations
   - Verify validation constraints on fields
   - Test type-specific behaviors for different zone types

2. **SafeZoneDao.java**:
   - Test CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Verify query methods return expected results
   - Test error handling for database exceptions
   - Mock database connections to isolate tests
   - Test pagination and filtering functionality

3. **SafeZoneService.java**:
   - Test business logic and validation rules
   - Verify proper interaction with the DAO layer (using mocks)
   - Test error handling and exception propagation
   - Verify authorization checks work correctly
   - Test any complex calculations or transformations

4. **SafeZoneHandler.java**:
   - Test request parsing and validation
   - Verify proper response formatting
   - Test error handling and appropriate status codes
   - Verify integration with the service layer
   - Test authentication and authorization checks

Use appropriate mocking frameworks (Mockito recommended) to isolate components during unit testing. For integration tests, consider using an in-memory database or test containers to provide realistic testing environments.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing Approach**:
   - Achieve at least 80% code coverage across all components
   - Use JUnit 5 for test framework
   - Use Mockito for mocking dependencies
   - Create separate test classes for each component (e.g., SafeZoneTest, SafeZoneDaoTest)
   - Group tests by functionality using nested test classes
   - Use parameterized tests for testing multiple inputs

2. **Integration Testing Approach**:
   - Test the full request-response cycle from handler through service to DAO
   - Use an in-memory database (H2) configured with the same schema
   - Test realistic scenarios including error conditions
   - Verify database state after operations

3. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Positive tests: Valid inputs produce expected outputs
   - Negative tests: Invalid inputs produce appropriate errors
   - Boundary tests: Edge cases like empty zones, maximum sizes
   - Performance tests: Verify operations complete within expected timeframes
   - Concurrency tests: Verify thread safety where applicable

4. **Validation**:
   - Run tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
   - Generate coverage reports to identify untested code
   - Review test results and coverage with team
   - Document any assumptions or limitations in tests
