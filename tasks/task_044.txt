# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement Geospatial Querying and Indexing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement a geospatial querying and indexing system that supports polygon-based boundaries, haversine distance calculations, and efficient geo-queries for the game's location-based features.
# Details:
This task requires implementing a comprehensive geospatial system according to requirements DSR-1.1 through DSR-1.4:

1. Create a spatial indexing structure that supports efficient querying of game elements within polygon-based geographical boundaries (DSR-1.1)
2. Implement haversine formula calculations to accurately determine distances between coordinates on the Earth's surface (DSR-1.2)
3. Develop a query API that supports the following operations:
   - Point-in-polygon testing
   - Radius-based proximity searches
   - Bounding box queries
   - K-nearest neighbor searches (DSR-1.3)
4. Optimize the spatial index for both read and write operations, ensuring query response times under 100ms for areas containing up to 10,000 game elements (DSR-1.4)
5. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed geographical regions
6. Create serialization/deserialization methods for geospatial data to support persistence
7. Ensure the implementation works with the existing database architecture
8. Document the API endpoints and query parameters for integration with other game systems

Consider using established geospatial libraries or database extensions (PostGIS, MongoDB geospatial indexes, etc.) where appropriate, but ensure they meet our performance requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both correctness and performance of the geospatial system:

1. Unit tests:
   - Verify point-in-polygon calculations with various polygon shapes (convex, concave, with holes)
   - Test haversine distance calculations against known values
   - Validate all query types with simple test cases

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the geospatial system with the actual database implementation
   - Verify correct indexing behavior when data is added, updated, or removed

3. Performance tests:
   - Benchmark query performance with datasets of increasing size (1K, 5K, 10K elements)
   - Measure response times for different query types and verify they meet the <100ms requirement
   - Test performance under concurrent access scenarios
   - Profile memory usage during heavy query loads

4. Edge case tests:
   - Test behavior at the International Date Line and poles
   - Verify handling of invalid geometries
   - Test with extremely large or small polygons

5. Create a visualization tool to display test results on a map for manual verification
