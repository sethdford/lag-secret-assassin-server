# Project Trajectory: Assassin Game API

## Overall Status
*Phase: Core Feature Implementation*

The project is actively implementing core functionalities based on the initial design. Foundational elements like project setup, database schema, user authentication, profile management, basic game management, target assignment, elimination verification, and leaderboards/achievements are complete. The current focus is heavily on the complex geolocation system, followed by monetization, items, and other supporting features.

## Completed Work (Tasks Marked as Done)

*   **Task 1:** Setup Project Repository and Base Structure
*   **Task 2:** Implement Database Schema Design
*   **Task 3:** Implement User Authentication System
*   **Task 4:** Implement User Profile Management
*   **Task 5:** Implement Game Creation and Management
*   **Task 7:** Implement Target Assignment System
    *   Subtask 7.1: Design and Implement Core Target Assignment Algorithm
    *   Subtask 7.2: Implement Target Reassignment on Elimination
    *   Subtask 7.3: Implement Target Data Storage and Retrieval
    *   Subtask 7.4: Create API Endpoint for Current Target
    *   Subtask 7.5: (Optional/Future) Implement Target Reassignment via Items
*   **Task 8:** Implement Elimination Verification System
*   **Task 15:** Implement Leaderboards and Achievement System

## Milestone Progress
*Progress towards Phase 1 (MVP) Goals:*

*   **Core API implementation:** Partially complete (Auth, Profile, Game Mgmt, Target, Kill Verification, Leaderboards done; Geolocation in progress; Monetization, Items pending).
*   **Basic game mechanics:** Partially complete (Target assignment, Kill verification done; Geolocation-based mechanics pending).
*   **Essential safety features:** Pending (Task 13).
*   **Limited monetization:** Pending (Task 9).

*Overall, significant progress has been made on the foundational backend services. The next major hurdle is the geolocation system.* 

## Known Issues/Bugs
*No specific issues listed in tasks.json. Need to track issues reported during testing or development.*

## Velocity/Throughput
*Cannot be determined from current data. Needs tracking over time.*

## Risk Assessment
*Potential risks based on pending tasks:*

*   **Complexity of Geolocation (Task 6):** High risk due to technical challenges (accuracy, battery, performance, security).
*   **Monetization Implementation (Tasks 9, 10, 11):** Medium risk related to payment gateway integration, security (PCI), and balancing.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** Medium risk, requires careful testing under load (part of Task 18).
*   **Security:** Medium risk, requires ongoing diligence, especially with payments and location data.
*   **Third-Party Dependencies:** Low-Medium risk (mapping services, payment gateways).
