# Assassin Game API Project Overview

## Project Description
Assassin meets Pok√©mon Go but way more thrilling. The Assassin Game API is a serverless application built on AWS to support real-time location-based gameplay for "assassin" style games. The API provides the backend infrastructure for mobile applications that allow players to participate in an elimination-style game commonly played on college campuses and other environments.

## Key Features

### Authentication and User Management
- User registration and login with email/password
- Secure authentication using Amazon Cognito
- Player profile management
- Administrative privileges for game creators

### Game Management
- Create, update, and delete games
- Configure game rules and settings
- Support for various game modes (time-limited, objective-based)
- In-game notifications for key events
- Real-time game state tracking

### Location Tracking and Geofencing
- Real-time player location updates
- Geofencing to create game boundaries
- Proximity-based player elimination
- Safe zones with different types (permanent, temporary, shrinking)

### Kill/Elimination System
- Kill reporting with confirmation requirements
- Kill verification mechanisms (passwords, proximity, QR codes)
- Target assignment and reassignment
- Elimination statistics and leaderboards

### Social Features
- In-game messaging
- Status updates for remaining players
- Activity feeds for game events
- Integration with social media platforms

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Support for concurrent games with independent rules and players
2. Accurate location tracking with minimal battery impact
3. Real-time notifications for game events
4. Secure authentication and authorization
5. Target assignment and verification mechanisms
6. Game boundary enforcement
7. Safe zone implementation with multiple types
8. Administrative tools for game management
9. Leaderboards and statistics

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**: Support for thousands of concurrent users
2. **Performance**: Low-latency responses (<200ms) for critical operations
3. **Security**: Protection of user data and prevention of cheating
4. **Reliability**: High availability (>99.9%) for game services
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of network issues and server errors
6. **Maintainability**: Well-documented code with comprehensive test coverage
7. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized resource usage to minimize AWS costs

## Technology Stack

### AWS Services
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for API endpoints
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for game state and user data
- **Amazon API Gateway**: RESTful API management
- **Amazon Cognito**: User authentication and authorization
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **Amazon SNS**: Push notifications
- **AWS SAM**: Infrastructure as Code for deployment

### Development Tools
- **Java**: Primary programming language
- **AWS SDK for Java v2**: AWS service integration
- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation
- **Git**: Version control
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

## Project Goals

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement core game mechanics (player registration, game creation, target assignment)
2. Develop location tracking and geofencing capabilities
3. Create kill reporting and verification system
4. Establish secure authentication and authorization
5. Deploy initial version with basic features

### Medium-term Goals
1. Add support for different game modes and rule configurations
2. Implement advanced safe zone types (shrinking, temporary)
3. Develop comprehensive admin tools for game management
4. Create robust analytics for game statistics
5. Optimize performance and scalability

### Long-term Goals
1. Support for team-based gameplay
2. Integration with social media platforms
3. Advanced anti-cheating mechanisms
4. Support for custom game rules and plugins
5. Cross-platform client applications

## Stakeholders
- Game administrators (create and manage games)
- Players (participate in games)
- Developers (build and maintain the system)
- Campus organizations (sponsor and organize games)

## Timeline
- **Alpha Release**: Basic functionality with core game mechanics
- **Beta Release**: Complete feature set with limited user testing
- **Production Release**: Fully tested and optimized for scale
- **Ongoing Development**: Regular updates and new features

## Project Constraints
- Must be cost-effective to run on AWS
- Must support both iOS and Android clients
- Must ensure user privacy and data security
- Must function reliably in environments with variable connectivity
- Must minimize battery drain on mobile devices

## Success Criteria
- Support for at least 1,000 concurrent users
- Average API response time under 200ms
- 99.9% uptime for game services
- Positive user feedback on core gameplay mechanics
- Successful completion of multiple concurrent games
- Effective prevention of common cheating methods
