# Project Trajectory: Assassin Game API

## Overall Status
**Phase: Core Feature Implementation + Development Infrastructure Optimization**

The project has completed foundational elements and is actively implementing core functionalities. A comprehensive code review reveals excellent architectural foundation with ~1200 lines of well-structured Java code following hexagonal architecture patterns. Current session focus is on completing the critical geolocation system and establishing enhanced development workflows.

## Recent Session Updates 
**[2025-01-08 - Development Infrastructure & Code Review]**
- âœ… Completed comprehensive codebase review - Architecture and implementation quality confirmed excellent
- âœ… Validated tasks.json structure with 20 well-organized tasks and detailed subtasks
- âœ… Confirmed TaskMaster system fully operational with 17/58 tasks completed (29% done)
- âœ… Organized Memory Bank with logical numbering scheme (18 files, 140KB)
- âœ… Established Memory Bank â†” TaskMaster synchronization workflow
- âœ… **Enhanced OpenAPI specification to v1.0.2** - Added missing shrinking zone and payment endpoints (302 lines added)
- ðŸ”„ Ready to proceed with Task 43.2: Update Location Checks for Shrinking Zone

## Milestone Progress
*Progress towards Phase 1 (MVP) Goals:*

*   **Core API implementation:** Partially complete (Auth, Profile, Game Mgmt, Target, Kill Verification, Leaderboards done; Geolocation in progress; Monetization, Items pending).
*   **Basic game mechanics:** Partially complete (Target assignment, Kill verification done; Geolocation-based mechanics pending).
*   **Essential safety features:** Pending (Task 13).
*   **Limited monetization:** Pending (Task 9).

*Overall, significant progress has been made on the foundational backend services. The next major hurdle is the geolocation system.* 

## Known Issues/Bugs
*No specific issues listed in tasks.json. Need to track issues reported during testing or development.*

## Velocity/Throughput
*Cannot be determined from current data. Needs tracking over time.*

## Risk Assessment
*Potential risks based on pending tasks:*

*   **Complexity of Geolocation (Task 6):** High risk due to technical challenges (accuracy, battery, performance, security).
*   **Monetization Implementation (Tasks 9, 10, 11):** Medium risk related to payment gateway integration, security (PCI), and balancing.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** Medium risk, requires careful testing under load (part of Task 18).
*   **Security:** Medium risk, requires ongoing diligence, especially with payments and location data.
*   **Third-Party Dependencies:** Low-Medium risk (mapping services, payment gateways).
