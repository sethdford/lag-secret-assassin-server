# Current Focus & State: Assassin Game API

## Active Sprint/Cycle
**Current Session Focus**: Implementing shrinking safe zone mechanics and establishing Memory Bank â†” TaskMaster synchronization

## Recent Changes
**[2025-01-08 Session Updates]**
- Completed comprehensive code review of entire Assassin Game codebase
- Validated tasks.json file structure and confirmed 20 high-level tasks with detailed subtasks  
- Confirmed project setup is complete with TaskMaster fully operational
- Memory Bank system active and integrated with development workflow
- Established Memory Bank â†” TaskMaster synchronization process

**[Current Project Status Per TaskMaster]**
- **Progress**: 17 of 58 tasks completed (29.3% done)
- **Subtask Progress**: 59 of 123 subtasks completed (48% done)
- **Major Milestone**: Core game infrastructure complete

## Memory Bank â†” TaskMaster Synchronization Process

### **ðŸ”„ Sync Commands:**
1. **Before Starting Work**: `task-master next` + Update this file
2. **During Work**: `task-master update-subtask --id=X.Y --prompt="Implementation notes"`
3. **After Completing**: `task-master set-status --id=X.Y --status=done` + Update this file
4. **Weekly Review**: Compare this file with `task-master list` and reconcile differences

### **ðŸ“Š Key Sync Points:**
- **Current Task Status**: Always match TaskMaster's `next` command
- **Completed Tasks**: Update from TaskMaster's completed list
- **Immediate Priorities**: Based on TaskMaster's dependency chain
- **Blockers**: Reflect actual dependency status from TaskMaster

## Current Active Task (Per TaskMaster)
**Task 43.2**: **Update Location Checks for Shrinking Zone** (In Progress)
- **Parent**: Task 43 - Implement Shrinking Safe Zone Gameplay Mode  
- **Status**: in-progress
- **Dependencies**: 43.1 (completed)
- **Priority**: high

**Implementation Focus:**
- Modify LocationService and SafeZoneService to check against dynamic shrinking zone
- Integrate with existing geolocation system for zone boundary enforcement
- Apply damage mechanics for players outside shrinking boundaries

## Immediate Priorities (Per TaskMaster Dependencies)
**Next Development Tasks (In Priority Order):**

1. **Complete Task 43.2**: Update Location Checks for Shrinking Zone (ACTIVE)
2. **Task 43.3**: Integrate Zone State Machine with Game Lifecycle (pending)  
3. **Task 43.4**: Implement Time Advancement and Stage Triggering (pending)
4. **Task 43.5**: Implement Damage Outside Zone (pending)
5. **Task 43.6**: Implement Zone Transition Logic (pending)

## Major Completed Tasks (Per TaskMaster)
**âœ… Foundation Complete (Tasks 1-15):**
- Core project setup, database schema, authentication system
- User profile management, game creation and management
- **Geolocation and boundary system (Task 6) - COMPLETE** âœ…
- Target assignment system, elimination verification
- Basic monetization infrastructure, in-game items and inventory
- Subscription tiers, safe zone management  
- Privacy controls, safety and moderation tools
- Leaderboards and achievement system

**âœ… Recent Completions:**
- Task 28: Comprehensive Safe Zone System (done)
- Task 57: AWS SAM Template Configuration Fixes (done)

## Current Code Quality Status
**Architecture**: âœ… Excellent - Hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns
**Implementation**: âœ… Comprehensive - Substantial Java codebase with 17 major features implemented
**Testing**: âœ… Strong foundation - Unit and integration test structure in place
**Standards**: âœ… Consistent - Following Java best practices and AWS patterns
**Progress**: âœ… Strong momentum - 29% task completion, 48% subtask completion

## Open Questions
- Specific performance optimization needs for shrinking zone calculations
- Client-side integration requirements for zone damage mechanics
- Testing strategy for time-based zone transitions
- UI/UX considerations for zone warning indicators

## Blockers
- None currently - Task 43.2 is ready for implementation
- All dependencies satisfied for current task

## Session Context
**Development Environment**: Ready for immediate coding
**Memory Bank**: Fully active and tracking project context
**TaskMaster**: Operational with 58 tasks (17 complete, 1 in-progress, 40 pending)
**Current Focus**: Shrinking Safe Zone system implementation

## Recent Learnings & Implementation Notes
**From TaskMaster Task History:**
- Core game infrastructure is solid and well-architected
- Advanced features like monetization, subscriptions, and moderation are implemented
- Safe zone system foundation is complete, enabling shrinking zone implementation  
- Project has reached significant maturity with comprehensive feature set

**Implementation Patterns Established:**
- Hexagonal architecture with clear service boundaries
- DynamoDB data access objects with proper abstractions
- AWS SAM template organization for Lambda functions
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing approach
