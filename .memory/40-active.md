# Current Focus & State: Assassin Game API

## Active Sprint/Cycle
**Current Session Focus**: Code review completion and Memory Bank system optimization

## Recent Changes
**[2025-01-08 Session Updates]**
- Completed comprehensive code review of entire Assassin Game codebase
- Validated tasks.json file structure and confirmed 20 high-level tasks with detailed subtasks  
- Confirmed project setup is complete with TaskMaster fully operational
- Memory Bank system active and integrated with development workflow

**[Previous Completed Tasks]**
- Completed core project setup (Task 1)
- Implemented database schema design (Task 2) 
- Implemented User Authentication (Task 3)
- Implemented User Profile Management (Task 4)
- Implemented Game Creation and Management (Task 5)
- Implemented Target Assignment System (Task 7)
- Implemented Elimination Verification System (Task 8)

## Immediate Priorities
**Next Development Tasks (In Priority Order):**

1. **Implement Geolocation and Boundary System (Task 6 - In Progress):** Critical location-based game mechanics
   - Integrate Mapping Service and Basic Geolocation (Subtask 6.1 - Pending)
   - Implement Geofencing for Game Boundaries (Subtask 6.2 - Pending)
   - Develop Proximity Detection for Eliminations (Subtask 6.3 - Pending)
   - Implement Safe Zone System (Subtask 6.4 - Pending)
   - Secure Location Data Storage and Optimization (Subtask 6.5 - Pending)

2. **Implement Basic Monetization Infrastructure (Task 9 - Pending):** Payment processing foundation
3. **Implement Safety & Moderation Tools (Task 13 - Pending):** Essential for player safety
4. **Implement In-Game Items and Inventory System (Task 10 - Pending):** Core monetization features

## Current Code Quality Status
**Architecture**: ✅ Excellent - Hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns
**Implementation**: ✅ Comprehensive - ~1200 lines of well-structured Java code
**Testing**: ✅ Strong foundation - Unit and integration test structure in place
**Standards**: ✅ Consistent - Following Java best practices and AWS patterns

## Open Questions
- Specific mapping service selection (Google Maps vs AWS Location Service)
- Payment processor details beyond Stripe/PayPal framework  
- Detailed UX flows for geolocation features
- Performance testing methodology for location updates

## Blockers
- Task 6 (Geolocation) completion blocking several dependent features
- Third-party service integration decisions pending

## Session Context
**Development Environment**: Ready for immediate coding
**Memory Bank**: Fully active and tracking project context
**TaskMaster**: Operational with 20 tasks organized and validated

## Recent Learnings
*Derived from the nature of completed tasks.*
- Established core data models and relationships.
- Implemented secure authentication patterns.
- Defined basic game lifecycle management.
- Created initial target assignment logic.
