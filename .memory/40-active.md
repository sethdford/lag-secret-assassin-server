## Recent Learnings & Implementation Notes
**From Task 43.3 Implementation:**
- GameService now fully integrates with shrinking zone lifecycle management
- Zone state is automatically initialized when games start (if shrinking zone enabled)
- Zone state is automatically cleaned up when games end (both forced and natural completion)
- Error handling prevents zone failures from breaking game operations
- Comprehensive logging provides full visibility into zone lifecycle events

**From Task 43.2 Implementation:**
- LocationService now properly integrates with shrinking zone boundary checking
- SafeZoneService provides comprehensive safety evaluation (traditional + shrinking zones)
- Shrinking zone logic respects game configuration and zone phases
- Proper error handling prevents exploitation of zone checking failures
- Foundation established for damage application and zone state management

**Implementation Patterns Established:**
- ShrinkingZoneService integration through dependency injection
- Zone boundary checking using GeoUtils.calculateDistance()
- Defensive programming with null checks and error handling
- Comprehensive logging for zone boundary events and safety determinations
- Game lifecycle event integration with zone state management
