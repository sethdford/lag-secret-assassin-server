## Memory Bank ‚Üî TaskMaster Synchronization Process

### **üîÑ Sync Commands:**
1. **Before Starting Work**: `task-master next` + Update this file
2. **During Work**: `task-master update-subtask --id=X.Y --prompt="Implementation notes"`
3. **After Completing**: `task-master set-status --id=X.Y --status=done` + Update this file
4. **Weekly Review**: Compare this file with `task-master list` and reconcile differences

### **üìä Key Sync Points:**
- **Current Task Status**: Always match TaskMaster's `next` command
- **Completed Tasks**: Update from TaskMaster's completed list
- **Immediate Priorities**: Based on TaskMaster's dependency chain
- **Blockers**: Reflect actual dependency status from TaskMaster

## Current Active Task (Per TaskMaster)
**Task 43.4**: **Implement Time Advancement and Stage Triggering** (Pending ‚Üí Ready to Start)
- **Parent**: Task 43 - Implement Shrinking Safe Zone Gameplay Mode  
- **Status**: pending (dependencies met: 43.3 ‚úÖ)
- **Priority**: high

**Implementation Focus:**
- Implement scheduled zone progression and timer management
- Create stage transition triggers based on time
- Advance zone state through different phases (waiting, shrinking, stable)
- Integrate with zone state machine for automated progression

## Immediate Priorities (Per TaskMaster Dependencies)
**Next Development Tasks (In Priority Order):**

1. **Complete Task 43.4**: Implement Time Advancement and Stage Triggering (NEXT)
2. **Task 43.5**: Implement Damage Outside Zone (pending)
3. **Task 43.6**: Implement Zone Transition Logic (pending)
4. **Task 43.7**: Implement Zone State Machine (pending)

## Major Completed Tasks (Per TaskMaster)
**‚úÖ Foundation Complete (Tasks 1-15):**
- Core project setup, database schema, authentication system
- User profile management, game creation and management
- **Geolocation and boundary system (Task 6) - COMPLETE** ‚úÖ
- Target assignment system, elimination verification
- Basic monetization infrastructure, in-game items and inventory
- Subscription tiers, safe zone management  
- Privacy controls, safety and moderation tools
- Leaderboards and achievement system

**‚úÖ Recent Completions:**
- Task 28: Comprehensive Safe Zone System (done)
- Task 57: AWS SAM Template Configuration Fixes (done)
- **Task 43.2: Update Location Checks for Shrinking Zone (done)** ‚úÖ
- **Task 43.3: Integrate Zone State Machine with Game Lifecycle (done)** ‚úÖ

## Current Code Quality Status
**Architecture**: ‚úÖ Excellent - Hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive - Substantial Java codebase with full zone lifecycle integration
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Strong foundation - Unit and integration test structure in place

## Recent Learnings & Implementation Notes
**From Task 43.3 Implementation:**
- GameService now fully integrates with shrinking zone lifecycle management
- Zone state is automatically initialized when games start (if shrinking zone enabled)
- Zone state is automatically cleaned up when games end (both forced and natural completion)
- Error handling prevents zone failures from breaking game operations
- Comprehensive logging provides full visibility into zone lifecycle events

**From Task 43.2 Implementation:**
- LocationService now properly integrates with shrinking zone boundary checking
- SafeZoneService provides comprehensive safety evaluation (traditional + shrinking zones)
- Shrinking zone logic respects game configuration and zone phases
- Proper error handling prevents exploitation of zone checking failures
- Foundation established for damage application and zone state management

**Implementation Patterns Established:**
- ShrinkingZoneService integration through dependency injection
- Zone boundary checking using GeoUtils.calculateDistance()
- Defensive programming with null checks and error handling
- Comprehensive logging for zone boundary events and safety determinations
- Game lifecycle event integration with zone state management
