# Task ID: 32
# Title: Develop Infrastructure Scaling Plan for WebSocket-based Real-time Notification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive scaling plan for the AWS Lambda-based real-time notification system to efficiently handle 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections with optimized resource allocation.
# Details:
Design a detailed infrastructure scaling plan that addresses the following components:

1. AWS Lambda Configuration:
   - Implement provisioned concurrency for critical notification handlers
   - Configure reserved concurrency limits to prevent resource starvation
   - Optimize memory allocation based on function workload analysis
   - Implement efficient connection pooling for downstream services
   - Set appropriate function timeouts based on operation complexity

2. DynamoDB Capacity Planning:
   - Calculate and configure appropriate read/write capacity units for connection tracking tables
   - Implement auto-scaling policies with target utilization of 70%
   - Design efficient partition key strategy to avoid hot partitions
   - Consider on-demand capacity mode for unpredictable workloads
   - Implement TTL for connection records to manage stale connections

3. WebSocket Connection Management:
   - Design connection lifecycle management (connect/disconnect/heartbeat)
   - Implement connection pooling and reuse strategies
   - Create a connection pruning mechanism for idle connections
   - Develop a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff
   - Implement message batching for high-throughput scenarios

4. API Gateway Configuration:
   - Configure appropriate throttling limits for WebSocket APIs
   - Implement request validation to reduce invalid traffic
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for connection count thresholds
   - Configure appropriate timeout settings for WebSocket connections
   - Implement route selection expressions for efficient message routing

5. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Set up detailed CloudWatch metrics for connection counts, message throughput, and latency
   - Create dashboards for real-time visibility into system performance
   - Configure alarms for critical thresholds (connection count, error rates, latency)
   - Implement X-Ray tracing for end-to-end request visibility

The plan should include specific configuration values, scaling thresholds, and implementation details for each component.

# Test Strategy:
The scaling plan should be validated through the following testing approach:

1. Load Testing:
   - Use tools like Artillery or Locust to simulate 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections
   - Gradually increase connection count from 100 to 2000 to identify scaling bottlenecks
   - Maintain connections for extended periods (1+ hours) to test stability
   - Simulate realistic message patterns with varying payload sizes
   - Measure and record connection success rates, message delivery times, and error rates

2. Performance Benchmarking:
   - Establish baseline metrics for CPU utilization, memory usage, and response times
   - Compare metrics against defined performance targets (e.g., <100ms message delivery)
   - Identify resource utilization patterns across different connection counts
   - Document scaling behavior as connection count increases

3. Failure Testing:
   - Simulate AWS service degradation scenarios (Lambda throttling, DynamoDB throttling)
   - Test reconnection mechanisms during service disruptions
   - Validate graceful degradation under extreme load conditions
   - Verify alert triggering for predefined thresholds

4. Cost Analysis:
   - Calculate projected costs at different usage tiers (500, 1000, 2000 connections)
   - Compare cost-efficiency of different scaling strategies
   - Identify opportunities for cost optimization

5. Documentation Validation:
   - Ensure all configuration values are explicitly documented
   - Verify that scaling triggers and thresholds are clearly defined
   - Confirm that monitoring dashboards and alerts are properly specified
   - Review the plan with infrastructure and operations teams for feasibility

The plan will be considered validated when it demonstrates stable operation with 1000+ concurrent connections while maintaining message delivery latency under 100ms and error rates below 0.1%.

# Subtasks:

Implementation steps:
1. Create a WebSocket API in API Gateway with appropriate route selection expressions ($connect, $disconnect, $default, and custom routes)
2. Configure connection timeout settings to 10 minutes to balance resource usage and user experience
3. Implement request validation using JSON Schema to filter invalid messages before they reach Lambda
4. Set up throttling limits: 1000 requests per second for $connect route, 3000 requests per second for message routes
5. Configure service integrations with Lambda functions for each route
6. Implement a custom authorizer Lambda function for the $connect route to authenticate connections
7. Set up CloudWatch logging with appropriate log levels

Testing approach:
- Use WebSocket testing tools (like wscat) to verify connection establishment
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Verify route selection works correctly for different message types
- Confirm throttling settings are applied correctly using load testing tools

## 2. Optimize DynamoDB for WebSocket Connection Storage and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Design and configure DynamoDB tables for efficient connection tracking, with appropriate capacity planning and partition strategy
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a ConnectionsTable with connectionId as partition key and appropriate attributes (userId, connectionTime, lastActivity)
2. Configure TTL on the ConnectionsTable with a 2-hour expiration to automatically clean up stale connections
3. Implement efficient partition key strategy using userId as a sort key to avoid hot partitions
4. Set up auto-scaling policies with target utilization of 70% for both read and write capacity
5. Configure initial capacity: 20 WCU and 80 RCU for the ConnectionsTable
6. Create a secondary index on userId to enable efficient querying of connections by user
7. Implement a connection pruning Lambda function that runs every 30 minutes to clean up idle connections (inactive for >15 minutes)

Testing approach:
- Load test with simulated connection patterns to verify partition strategy prevents hot partitions
- Verify TTL functionality by creating test connections and confirming automatic deletion
- Test auto-scaling by gradually increasing connection load and monitoring capacity adjustments
