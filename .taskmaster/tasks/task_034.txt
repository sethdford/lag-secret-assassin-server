# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Push Notification Fallback Mechanism in NotificationService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a fallback mechanism within the NotificationService that automatically switches to alternative notification methods when push notifications fail to deliver.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. Create a notification delivery status tracking system that monitors push notification delivery success/failure
2. Implement fallback logic that triggers when push notifications fail with specific error codes (e.g., device token expired, service unavailable)
3. Define a fallback hierarchy: push notification → in-app notification → email → SMS (configurable per user preference)
4. Add a retry mechanism that attempts push notification delivery 3 times before falling back
5. Implement a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable push notifications if failure rate exceeds 30% in a 5-minute window
6. Create a configuration interface allowing admins to adjust fallback rules and thresholds
7. Add detailed logging for all fallback events including reason for fallback, alternative method used, and delivery status
8. Ensure the fallback process is asynchronous and doesn't block the main notification flow
9. Update the NotificationService interface to expose methods for checking notification status
10. Implement rate limiting to prevent flooding alternative channels during mass fallbacks

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the detection of failures and the correct execution of fallbacks:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test fallback logic with mocked push notification failures
   - Verify correct fallback channel selection based on user preferences
   - Test retry mechanism with various error scenarios
   - Validate circuit breaker functionality with simulated high failure rates

2. Integration tests:
   - Test end-to-end notification delivery with simulated push service outages
   - Verify correct fallback to each alternative channel
   - Test notification status tracking across the entire delivery pipeline

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure latency impact of fallback mechanism under normal conditions
   - Test system behavior under high load with various fallback scenarios
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits during fallbacks

4. Specific test cases:
   - Push notification fails with "InvalidToken" → verify fallback to in-app notification
   - Push service returns 503 → verify retry logic and eventual fallback
   - Circuit breaker trips → verify temporary routing to alternative channels
   - User without email but with SMS → verify correct fallback to SMS
   - All channels fail → verify proper error handling and logging
