# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Push Notification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive push notification system for game events, alerts, and administrative announcements.
# Details:
Integrate with push notification services (Firebase, Apple Push Notification Service). Implement different notification types (game events, proximity alerts, safety warnings, announcements). Create templates for different notification types. Add user preferences for notification settings. Implement batching for high-volume notifications. Create an admin interface for sending announcements.

# Test Strategy:
Test notification delivery for different event types. Verify user preferences correctly filter notifications. Test high-volume notification scenarios. Verify administrative announcements reach intended recipients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhance Notification Model and DAO Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the existing Notification model and DynamoDbNotificationDao to support different notification types and user preferences
### Details:
1. Update the Notification model to include fields for: notification type (enum: GAME_EVENT, PROXIMITY_ALERT, SAFETY_WARNING, ANNOUNCEMENT), priority level, template ID, delivery status, and timestamp.
2. Add user preference fields to the User model to store notification settings (which types they want to receive).
3. Extend DynamoDbNotificationDao to support CRUD operations for the enhanced model, including batch operations for high-volume scenarios.
4. Implement filtering methods in the DAO to query notifications by type, status, and user preferences.
5. Add unit tests for the enhanced model and DAO methods using mock DynamoDB.
6. Test with sample notification data covering all notification types.

## 2. Implement Notification Templates System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create a template system for different notification types with placeholders for dynamic content
### Details:
1. Design a NotificationTemplate model with fields for template ID, notification type, title template, body template, and optional image URL.
2. Create a TemplateService that loads templates and populates them with dynamic content.
3. Implement template validation to ensure all required placeholders are provided when sending a notification.
4. Create default templates for each notification type (game events, proximity alerts, safety warnings, announcements).
5. Add a caching mechanism for frequently used templates to improve performance.
6. Write unit tests for template rendering with various placeholder combinations.
7. Test template rendering with edge cases like missing placeholders and special characters.

## 3. Integrate with Push Notification Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Connect the notification system with Firebase Cloud Messaging and Apple Push Notification Service
### Details:
1. Create a PushServiceAdapter interface with implementations for different providers (FirebasePushAdapter, APNSPushAdapter).
2. Implement the connection to Firebase Cloud Messaging using their SDK/API for Android devices.
3. Implement the connection to Apple Push Notification Service for iOS devices.
4. Add configuration for API keys, certificates, and endpoints in a secure manner.
5. Implement retry logic and error handling for failed push attempts.
6. Create a PushServiceFactory to select the appropriate adapter based on the user's device type.
7. Write integration tests using sandbox/test environments for both services.
8. Implement metrics collection for success/failure rates of notifications.

## 4. Enhance NotificationService with Business Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Update the NotificationService to handle different notification types, user preferences, and delivery strategies
### Details:
1. Enhance NotificationService to use the template system when creating notifications.
2. Implement filtering logic to respect user notification preferences.
3. Add support for notification batching to handle high-volume scenarios efficiently.
4. Implement priority-based delivery for urgent notifications.
5. Create specialized handlers for each notification type (GameEventNotificationHandler, AlertNotificationHandler, etc.).
6. Add scheduling capabilities for delayed or recurring notifications.
7. Implement notification delivery status tracking and reporting.
8. Write unit tests for the business logic, particularly around user preference filtering.
9. Test the batching mechanism with large volumes of notifications.

## 5. Build Admin Interface for Notification Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Create an administrative interface for sending announcements and managing the notification system
### Details:
1. Design REST API endpoints for administrative notification operations.
2. Implement controller methods for sending announcements to all users or targeted user segments.
3. Create endpoints for managing notification templates.
4. Add functionality to view notification delivery statistics and failure reports.
5. Implement authorization checks to ensure only admin users can access these endpoints.
6. Add validation for announcement content and targeting parameters.
7. Create integration tests for the admin API endpoints.
8. Test the admin interface with various announcement scenarios including targeted announcements and system-wide alerts.
