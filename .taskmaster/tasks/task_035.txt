# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Unit Test Suite for NotificationService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a complete set of unit tests for the NotificationService to ensure all methods, edge cases, and error handling are properly tested.
# Details:
This task involves creating unit tests for all remaining untested methods and scenarios in the NotificationService. The developer should:

1. Review existing tests to identify gaps in coverage
2. Write tests for all public methods including:
   - notification creation and formatting
   - delivery mechanisms (email, SMS, push, in-app)
   - notification preferences and user targeting
   - scheduling and throttling logic
   - template rendering
   - localization handling
3. Include tests for error conditions such as:
   - invalid notification parameters
   - delivery failures
   - rate limiting scenarios
   - missing user information
4. Use mocks for external dependencies (email service, SMS gateway, etc.)
5. Test asynchronous behavior where applicable
6. Verify proper logging of notification events
7. Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
8. Aim for at least 90% code coverage for the NotificationService class

# Test Strategy:
Verification will involve:

1. Run the complete test suite to ensure all tests pass
2. Verify code coverage metrics meet or exceed 90% for the NotificationService
3. Review test quality using the following criteria:
   - Each test should have clear arrange-act-assert structure
   - Tests should be independent and not affect each other
   - Edge cases should be covered (empty notifications, large payloads, etc.)
   - Mocks should be properly used to isolate the service
   - Assertions should be specific and meaningful
4. Perform mutation testing to ensure tests catch actual bugs
5. Verify that tests run efficiently (under 5 seconds for the entire suite)
6. Check that both positive paths (successful notifications) and negative paths (failures, errors) are tested
7. Ensure all public methods have at least basic test coverage
