# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement Data Export and Analysis Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop APIs and backend services to export game data in standardized formats (JSON, CSV) for external analysis and visualization, including game statistics, player performance metrics, and location heatmaps.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive data export system as specified in requirement IR-2.4. The developer should:

1. Create RESTful API endpoints for data export with the following capabilities:
   - Export game statistics (scores, completion rates, time spent)
   - Export player performance metrics (accuracy, response times, success rates)
   - Export location data suitable for heatmap generation

2. Implement data formatting services that can output in:
   - JSON format with proper structure and metadata
   - CSV format with appropriate headers and data organization

3. Design the backend services to:
   - Efficiently query and aggregate game data from the database
   - Apply appropriate filters based on time periods, player IDs, or game sessions
   - Handle large datasets with pagination and streaming capabilities
   - Include proper error handling and validation

4. Add documentation for the API endpoints including:
   - Request parameters and format
   - Response structure
   - Example usage

5. Ensure all exported data is anonymized appropriately to protect user privacy while maintaining analytical value.

The implementation should be modular and extensible to allow for additional export formats or data types in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Verify data formatting functions correctly convert game data to JSON and CSV
   - Test data aggregation logic for accuracy
   - Ensure proper error handling for invalid requests

2. API endpoint tests:
   - Confirm all endpoints return correct HTTP status codes
   - Validate response formats match specifications
   - Test with various query parameters to ensure filtering works correctly
   - Verify pagination functions as expected with large datasets

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure response times for exports of various sizes
   - Test system behavior under load with concurrent export requests
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits for large exports

4. Integration tests:
   - Confirm exported data can be successfully imported into common analysis tools
   - Verify heatmap data can be visualized correctly in standard visualization libraries
   - Test end-to-end flow from game events to exported analysis data

5. Manual validation:
   - Sample exports should be reviewed for data accuracy and completeness
   - Verify that exported files maintain integrity and can be opened in target applications (Excel, data analysis tools)
   - Check that anonymization is properly applied to protect user privacy
