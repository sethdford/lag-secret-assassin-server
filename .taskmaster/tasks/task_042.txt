# Task ID: 42
# Title: Develop End-to-End Game Simulation Framework with Time Acceleration and Analytics Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 6, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive simulation framework that automates complete game lifecycles with configurable player behaviors, time acceleration capabilities, and analytics integration for testing game balance and generating visual reports.
# Details:
Implement a modular simulation framework with the following components:

1. **Player Simulation Module**:
   - Create automated player generation with configurable parameters (skill level, activity patterns, play style)
   - Implement player behavior patterns using state machines or behavior trees
   - Support batch creation of 10-1000+ simulated players with distinct characteristics

2. **Game Setup and Progression Engine**:
   - Automate game initialization, player registration, and target assignment
   - Implement configurable game rules and parameters
   - Create a time acceleration system that can compress days/weeks of gameplay into minutes
   - Include temporal checkpoints to analyze game state at specific intervals

3. **Interaction Simulation System**:
   - Model realistic player movements using geospatial algorithms
   - Simulate various player interactions (target acquisition, verification attempts)
   - Implement different verification methods (photo, QR code, location-based, etc.)
   - Create edge case scenarios (verification failures, disputes, timeouts)

4. **Analytics Integration Layer**:
   - Connect simulation outputs to analytics pipeline
   - Track key metrics: player engagement, game balance, completion rates
   - Implement hooks for custom metric collection
   - Create data export capabilities for external analysis

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Generate comprehensive reports of simulation runs
   - Create visualizations for game dynamics (player elimination patterns, activity hotspots)
   - Implement timeline views of critical game events
   - Support comparison between different simulation configurations

The framework should be configurable via JSON or YAML files and include a command-line interface for running simulations with different parameters. Use dependency injection to allow components to be replaced with mock implementations for testing.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be conducted at multiple levels:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each module independently with mock dependencies
   - Verify player behavior models produce expected actions given specific inputs
   - Test time acceleration logic with different compression ratios
   - Validate report generation with predefined simulation data

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between modules (e.g., player simulation feeding into analytics)
   - Verify data consistency across the simulation pipeline
   - Test with different game configuration parameters

3. **System Tests**:
   - Run end-to-end simulations with small player counts (10-50) and verify results
   - Test with extreme parameters (very short/long games, high/low player counts)
   - Validate time acceleration with known expected outcomes

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure simulation performance with large player counts (1000+)
   - Profile memory usage during extended simulations
   - Test time acceleration with different hardware configurations

5. **Validation Tests**:
   - Compare simulation results with historical game data
   - Verify that known game balance issues are detected by the analytics
   - Run A/B tests with different game parameters to ensure the framework can detect meaningful differences

Implement automated test scripts that can be run as part of CI/CD pipeline. Create a test dashboard that visualizes test coverage and simulation accuracy metrics.
