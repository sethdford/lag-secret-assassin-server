# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement National Heatmap and Leaderboard System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system that tracks game activity across regions, displays data on a national heatmap, and maintains regional and national leaderboards with statistics for cross-state player eliminations.
# Details:
Create a scalable backend architecture to process and store game activity data with geographic metadata. The system should:

1. Implement a geospatial database structure to store player activities tagged with location data (state/region coordinates)
2. Develop RESTful APIs for:
   - Submitting game activity events with location data
   - Retrieving heatmap data aggregated by region
   - Accessing regional and national leaderboards
   - Querying cross-state elimination statistics
3. Build a real-time data processing pipeline using websockets or server-sent events to update the heatmap as games progress
4. Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed leaderboard and heatmap data to improve performance
5. Create aggregation functions to calculate regional activity intensity for heatmap visualization
6. Develop leaderboard ranking algorithms that can be filtered by region or viewed nationally
7. Implement specialized statistics tracking for cross-state eliminations, including aggressor/victim state pairs
8. Ensure the system can handle traffic spikes during peak gaming hours
9. Include data retention policies and aggregation methods for historical data
10. Provide documentation for frontend integration with the heatmap visualization component

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance of the system:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test all API endpoints with various input parameters
   - Verify correct calculation of leaderboard rankings
   - Test geospatial data processing functions
   - Validate cross-state elimination statistics calculations

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the complete data flow from game activity submission to heatmap/leaderboard updates
   - Verify real-time updates are correctly propagated
   - Test regional filtering and aggregation

3. Performance tests:
   - Simulate high-volume game activity (1000+ events per second)
   - Measure response times for heatmap and leaderboard API endpoints under load
   - Test caching effectiveness with repeated queries

4. Data validation tests:
   - Verify geographic data is correctly mapped to regions
   - Ensure leaderboard rankings are accurate and consistent
   - Validate that cross-state elimination statistics match expected outcomes

5. End-to-end tests:
   - Create a test harness that simulates nationwide game activity
   - Verify the heatmap correctly reflects activity intensity by region
   - Confirm leaderboard updates reflect game outcomes in real-time
