# Task ID: 66
# Title: Implement World Heist Game Plugin
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 64
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a cooperative mission-based game type where players work together to complete heist objectives with role-based gameplay, inventory management, stealth mechanics, and both competitive and cooperative win conditions.
# Details:
1. Design the core World Heist game mechanics:
   - Create a WorldHeistGamePlugin class implementing the GameTypePlugin interface
   - Define game initialization, configuration, and lifecycle methods
   - Implement mission generation system with randomized objectives and difficulty scaling

2. Implement role-based player system:
   - Create PlayerRole enum with specialized roles (Hacker, Lookout, Infiltrator, etc.)
   - Implement role-specific abilities and limitations
   - Design role selection and balancing mechanism for teams
   - Add role-specific UI elements and feedback

3. Develop inventory and resource management:
   - Create InventoryItem class with properties (weight, value, rarity, effects)
   - Implement player inventory with capacity limits based on role
   - Add resource collection mechanics (lockpicks, hacking tools, disguises)
   - Design crafting/combining system for creating specialized equipment

4. Implement stealth and detection mechanics:
   - Create StealthLevel enum (Hidden, Suspicious, Detected, Compromised)
   - Implement noise generation and propagation system
   - Add guard/NPC patrol patterns and vision cones
   - Design alert levels and response escalation

5. Create heist objective system:
   - Implement ObjectiveItem class for stealable items
   - Create Location class with security levels and entry points
   - Design multi-stage objectives requiring team coordination
   - Add randomized objective placement and security measures

6. Implement win conditions:
   - Create cooperative win condition (all objectives completed, team escapes)
   - Add competitive elements (most valuable items, fastest completion)
   - Implement failure conditions (team detected, time expired)
   - Design scoring system based on stealth, efficiency, and value

7. Develop game state management:
   - Create HeistGameState class extending from the universal player state
   - Implement team synchronization for shared objectives
   - Add persistent progression between missions
   - Design reputation system affecting future mission difficulty

8. Create specialized player actions:
   - Implement HackSecurityAction, PickLockAction, DistractGuardAction
   - Add StealItemAction, DisableAlarmAction, CreateDiversionAction
   - Design team-based actions requiring multiple players

9. Implement event handlers:
   - Create ObjectiveCompletedEvent, AlarmTriggeredEvent, TeamExtractionEvent
   - Add handlers for role-specific events
   - Implement cascading event effects (e.g., alarm triggering guard response)

10. Design configuration options:
    - Create difficulty settings (security level, time limits, objective complexity)
    - Add customization for available roles and team size
    - Implement mission type selection (bank heist, museum theft, corporate espionage)
    - Design reward scaling based on difficulty

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each role's abilities and limitations
   - Test inventory management with various item combinations
   - Verify stealth mechanics with different scenarios (noise levels, guard positions)
   - Test objective completion logic and win condition evaluation
   - Validate event handling for all game events

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test role interactions and team coordination mechanics
   - Verify proper integration with the game type plugin system
   - Test configuration system with various game settings
   - Validate database interactions for saving/loading game state
   - Test event propagation through the event-driven architecture

3. System Testing:
   - Conduct end-to-end tests of complete heist missions
   - Test performance with maximum player count and complex objectives
   - Verify proper handling of edge cases (disconnections, partial team completion)
   - Test compatibility with existing game features (leaderboards, achievements)

4. Playtest Scenarios:
   - Create specific test scenarios for each role combination
   - Test balanced gameplay with different team compositions
   - Verify difficulty scaling works appropriately
   - Test competitive elements for fairness and engagement
   - Conduct timed playtests to ensure missions are completable

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Organize playtests with real users for feedback
   - Collect metrics on mission completion rates and role popularity
   - Evaluate user feedback on difficulty and enjoyment
   - Test tutorial effectiveness for new players
   - Verify UI clarity for role-specific actions and objectives

6. Security and Edge Case Testing:
   - Test handling of invalid actions or sequence breaking
   - Verify proper error handling for unexpected states
   - Test concurrent actions from multiple team members
   - Validate state consistency during network interruptions
