# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Geolocation and Boundary System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the geolocation tracking system with geofencing capabilities for game boundaries and safe zones.
# Details:
Integrate with mapping services (Google Maps/Mapbox) for geolocation. Implement real-time location updates with configurable frequency. Create geofencing functionality for game boundaries. Implement proximity detection for eliminations. Add support for different types of safe zones (public, private, timed, relocatable). Ensure location data is securely stored and properly encrypted.

# Test Strategy:
Test location updates with mock location data. Verify geofencing correctly identifies in/out of bounds positions. Test proximity detection with various scenarios. Verify safe zone implementation works as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Mapping Service and Basic Geolocation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the integration with a mapping service (Google Maps or Mapbox) and implement basic geolocation tracking functionality.
### Details:
1. Research and select appropriate mapping service API (Google Maps or Mapbox)
2. Set up API keys and configure authentication
3. Implement a geolocation service class that handles:
   - Requesting user location permissions
   - Initializing the mapping service
   - Getting current user location
   - Displaying a map with the user's position
4. Implement basic location update mechanism with configurable frequency
5. Create a simple UI component to display the map and current location
6. Test location accuracy and update frequency on different devices
7. Implement proper error handling for location services being unavailable

## 2. Implement Geofencing for Game Boundaries [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the geofencing system to define and enforce game boundaries, including detection when players cross boundaries.
### Details:
1. Design a data structure to represent game boundaries (polygon, circle, etc.)
2. Implement a GeofenceManager class to:
   - Create geofences from boundary definitions
   - Register geofences with the mapping service
   - Monitor boundary crossings
   - Trigger events when players enter/exit boundaries
3. Create admin tools to define and modify game boundaries
4. Implement visual representation of boundaries on the map
5. Add client-side validation to warn players approaching boundaries
6. Create server-side validation to prevent cheating
7. Test boundary detection with various shapes and sizes
8. Implement graceful handling of GPS inaccuracy near boundaries

## 3. Develop Proximity Detection for Eliminations [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a system to detect when players are within elimination range of each other and trigger the appropriate game mechanics.
### Details:
1. Define proximity thresholds for different game modes/weapons
2. Implement a ProximityDetector class that:
   - Efficiently checks distances between players
   - Optimizes calculations for large player counts
   - Handles different proximity rules
3. Create a notification system for proximity alerts
4. Implement server-side validation of proximity claims
5. Add jitter/noise handling to account for GPS inaccuracy
6. Design and implement elimination confirmation UI
7. Test proximity detection in various environments (urban, open spaces)
8. Optimize battery usage during continuous proximity checking

## 4. Implement Safe Zone System [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create the safe zone system with support for different types (public, private, timed, relocatable) and the associated game mechanics.
### Details:
1. Design a SafeZone class hierarchy to support different zone types:
   - PublicSafeZone: accessible to all players
   - PrivateSafeZone: limited to specific players/teams
   - TimedSafeZone: active only during specific time periods
   - RelocatableSafeZone: can change position during gameplay
2. Implement zone creation, modification and deletion functionality
3. Create visual indicators for different safe zone types on the map
4. Implement rule enforcement within safe zones (no eliminations)
5. Add time-based triggers for timed safe zones
6. Create admin tools to manage safe zones during gameplay
7. Implement player notifications when entering/exiting safe zones
8. Test zone behavior with multiple players in various scenarios

## 5. Secure Location Data Storage and Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Implement secure storage and transmission of location data with proper encryption, and optimize the system for battery life and performance.
### Details:
1. Design a secure data structure for storing location history
2. Implement encryption for location data at rest and in transit
3. Create a data retention policy and cleanup mechanisms
4. Optimize location update frequency based on:
   - Player proximity to others
   - Proximity to boundaries/safe zones
   - Game state (active vs. inactive)
   - Battery level
5. Implement batched location updates to reduce network traffic
6. Add compression for location data transmission
7. Create analytics to monitor system performance
8. Perform security audit of the location tracking system
9. Test battery consumption in various usage scenarios
10. Implement fallback mechanisms for intermittent connectivity
