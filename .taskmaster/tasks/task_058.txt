# Task ID: 58
# Title: Task #58: Implement Automated OpenAPI Specification Maintenance Process
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a recurring maintenance process to keep the OpenAPI specification in docs/openapi.yaml updated whenever API endpoints are added or modified, ensuring complete and accurate API documentation.
# Details:
This task involves implementing an automated process to maintain the OpenAPI specification document located at docs/openapi.yaml. The implementation should:

1. Create a process (either automated via CI/CD or as a developer workflow) that triggers whenever API endpoints are added or modified.
2. Ensure the OpenAPI spec includes:
   - Complete documentation for all API endpoints
   - Request and response schemas for each endpoint
   - Error codes and their meanings
   - Example requests and responses
   - Authentication requirements
   - Rate limiting information (if applicable)

3. Implement validation of the OpenAPI specification to ensure:
   - The YAML is syntactically valid
   - All referenced schemas exist
   - No undocumented endpoints exist in the codebase
   - All documented endpoints exist in the codebase

4. Create guidelines for developers on how to document new endpoints as they are created, including templates or examples.

5. Consider implementing tooling to:
   - Auto-generate portions of the OpenAPI spec from code annotations/comments
   - Validate the spec against actual API implementation
   - Generate client libraries or documentation websites from the spec

6. Update the developer onboarding documentation to include information about maintaining the OpenAPI specification.

7. Ensure the process works with the existing CI/CD pipeline and doesn't block deployments unnecessarily.

# Test Strategy:
The implementation should be verified through the following steps:

1. Manual Testing:
   - Add a new API endpoint to the codebase without updating the OpenAPI spec
   - Run the maintenance process and verify the spec is updated correctly
   - Modify an existing endpoint and verify the changes are reflected in the spec
   - Intentionally create an invalid endpoint documentation and verify the validation catches the issues

2. Automated Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the validation components
   - Implement integration tests that verify the OpenAPI spec matches the actual API implementation
   - Set up CI/CD tests to ensure the spec remains valid on each commit

3. Documentation Verification:
   - Use an OpenAPI validator tool (like Swagger Validator) to verify the spec is valid
   - Generate API documentation from the spec and verify it's complete and accurate
   - Have another developer follow the process documentation to update the spec for a new endpoint

4. Client Testing:
   - Generate a client library from the OpenAPI spec
   - Write test code using the generated client to verify it works correctly against the actual API
   - Test error handling scenarios to ensure they match the documented error codes

5. Process Verification:
   - Document the process execution for several sprints to ensure it's being followed
   - Collect feedback from developers on the usability of the process
   - Measure the time required to maintain the documentation and look for optimization opportunities
