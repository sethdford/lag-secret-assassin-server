# Task ID: 64
# Title: Implement Game Type Configuration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 62, 63
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a configuration management system that allows game organizers to select and configure different game types with customizable parameters, validation logic, and an admin UI for game creation.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the configuration schema system:
   - Create a ConfigurationSchema class that defines the structure and validation rules for game type configurations
   - Implement field types (text, number, boolean, enum, array, nested objects) with validation rules
   - Add support for default values, required fields, and conditional visibility
   - Implement schema versioning to support future changes

2. Extend the GameTypePlugin interface:
   - Add getConfigurationSchema() method to provide the configuration schema for each game type
   - Add validateConfiguration(config) method to validate configuration against schema
   - Add applyConfiguration(config) method to initialize the game with specific configuration

3. Implement game type configuration templates:
   - Create base configuration templates for each game type (Assassin, Capture The Flag, World Heist)
   - Define common parameters across game types (game duration, team sizes, scoring rules)
   - Implement game-specific parameters:
     * Assassin: elimination verification method, safe zones, special abilities
     * Capture The Flag: flag respawn time, capture rules, territory definitions
     * World Heist: target locations, difficulty scaling, reward distribution

4. Develop the admin UI for game type configuration:
   - Create a game type selection interface with descriptions and examples
   - Implement a dynamic form generator that renders based on the configuration schema
   - Add real-time validation with error messages and suggestions
   - Implement preview functionality to visualize game settings
   - Add configuration templates and presets for quick setup

5. Implement configuration persistence:
   - Store configuration in the GameType table created in Task 63
   - Add versioning and history tracking for configurations
   - Implement configuration export/import functionality

6. Create configuration migration system:
   - Handle schema changes between versions
   - Provide upgrade paths for existing configurations
   - Implement backward compatibility for older configurations

7. Implement configuration inheritance and overrides:
   - Allow creating new configurations based on existing ones
   - Support partial updates to configurations
   - Implement organization-level default configurations

8. Add configuration testing tools:
   - Create a simulation mode to test configurations before deployment
   - Implement configuration analysis to identify potential balance issues
   - Add configuration comparison tools

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test the ConfigurationSchema class with various field types and validation rules
   - Verify schema validation correctly identifies invalid configurations
   - Test each game type plugin's configuration methods with valid and invalid inputs
   - Ensure configuration versioning and migration work correctly

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the configuration system integrates properly with the plugin architecture
   - Test that game initialization correctly applies configurations
   - Ensure database persistence and retrieval of configurations works as expected
   - Test configuration changes during active games (if supported)

3. UI Testing:
   - Verify the dynamic form generator correctly renders all field types
   - Test form validation provides appropriate error messages
   - Ensure conditional fields appear/disappear based on other selections
   - Test the preview functionality accurately represents game settings
   - Verify configuration templates load and apply correctly

4. Game Type Specific Testing:
   - For each game type (Assassin, Capture The Flag, World Heist):
     * Test all game-specific configuration parameters
     * Verify game behavior changes appropriately with different configurations
     * Test edge cases and extreme values for each parameter

5. Performance Testing:
   - Test loading and saving large configuration objects
   - Measure rendering time for complex configuration forms
   - Verify configuration validation performance with complex schemas

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have game organizers create configurations for different scenarios
   - Test the entire flow from configuration creation to game initialization
   - Gather feedback on usability of the configuration interface

7. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing Assassin game functionality works with the new configuration system
   - Verify all game types function correctly with default configurations
