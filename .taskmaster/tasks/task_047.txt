# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement GDPR Compliance Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate GDPR compliance features including data export/deletion mechanisms, consent management, and data retention policies to meet regulatory requirements specified in NFR-6.1 through NFR-6.4.
# Details:
This task requires implementing several key GDPR compliance features:

1. User Data Export (NFR-6.1):
   - Create an API endpoint for users to request their data
   - Implement a mechanism to collect all user data across databases
   - Generate downloadable exports in machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV)
   - Include metadata about what data is being provided

2. Data Deletion Mechanism (NFR-6.2):
   - Implement 'right to be forgotten' functionality
   - Create secure deletion workflows with verification
   - Ensure deletion cascades across all systems and backups
   - Provide confirmation of deletion to users

3. Consent Management (NFR-6.3):
   - Develop granular consent options for different data processing activities
   - Create clear consent collection UI with plain language explanations
   - Store consent records with timestamps and specific consent details
   - Implement consent withdrawal mechanisms

4. Data Retention Policies (NFR-6.4):
   - Implement automated data purging after retention periods expire
   - Create configurable retention periods for different data categories
   - Develop exception handling for legal holds
   - Ensure audit trails for data lifecycle events

5. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive data handling procedure documentation
   - Draft privacy policy updates reflecting these implementations
   - Document the data flow and processing activities
   - Prepare internal documentation for support and compliance teams

Technical considerations:
- Ensure all implementations are database-agnostic where possible
- Use encryption for all data transfers
- Implement proper logging for all GDPR-related actions
- Design for scalability to handle bulk requests

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify compliance with all GDPR requirements:

1. User Data Export Testing:
   - Verify exports contain all required user data from all systems
   - Validate export format is machine-readable and properly structured
   - Test export functionality with various user profiles and data volumes
   - Verify performance under load (simulate multiple concurrent export requests)

2. Data Deletion Testing:
   - Confirm complete removal of user data across all systems
   - Verify deletion cascades properly to related records
   - Test edge cases (users with complex data relationships)
   - Validate audit trails correctly record deletion events

3. Consent Management Testing:
   - Verify all consent options are correctly presented to users
   - Test consent withdrawal functionality
   - Validate consent records are properly stored with accurate timestamps
   - Ensure processing respects consent settings (e.g., marketing emails not sent without consent)

4. Data Retention Testing:
   - Verify automatic data purging works after retention periods
   - Test retention policy exceptions function correctly
   - Validate data lifecycle management across different data categories

5. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on all GDPR-related endpoints
   - Verify authentication and authorization controls
   - Test for potential data leakage

6. Documentation Review:
   - Have legal team review privacy policy updates
   - Verify technical documentation accuracy
   - Conduct stakeholder review of all GDPR-related documentation

7. Compliance Validation:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on NFR-6.1 through NFR-6.4
   - Perform a full GDPR compliance audit after implementation
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement
