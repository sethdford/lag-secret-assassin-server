# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement Mobile Proximity Awareness with Geofencing and Distance Indicators
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a mobile feature that tracks player locations, establishes geofences around targets, and provides real-time distance indicators to enhance the gameplay experience.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a location-based proximity awareness system with the following components:

1. Location Services Integration:
   - Implement background location tracking using the device's GPS
   - Optimize for battery usage with adaptive polling frequencies based on proximity to targets
   - Handle permission requests and graceful degradation when permissions are denied

2. Geofencing Implementation:
   - Create dynamic geofences around target locations with configurable radii (50m, 100m, 200m)
   - Register for entry/exit events when players cross geofence boundaries
   - Implement a caching mechanism to limit API calls for geofence updates

3. Distance Calculation and Display:
   - Develop an algorithm to calculate real-time distances between players and targets
   - Create a visually intuitive UI component showing distance to target (both numeric and visual indicator)
   - Implement different states for distance indicators (far, medium, close, very close)

4. Map Integration:
   - Display player and nearby target locations on an interactive map
   - Implement heat zones or radius indicators showing proximity boundaries
   - Add directional indicators pointing toward targets when not in map view

5. Technical Considerations:
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
   - Implement proper error handling for GPS signal loss
   - Create a fallback mechanism using cell tower triangulation when GPS is unavailable
   - Ensure GDPR compliance with location data handling
   - Add user settings to control location tracking precision and frequency

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance of the proximity awareness system:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify geofence creation with different radii configurations
   - Test geofence entry/exit event triggering at various speeds of movement
   - Validate distance calculations against known reference points
   - Confirm UI updates correctly reflect distance changes
   - Test permission flows and graceful degradation scenarios

2. Performance Testing:
   - Measure battery consumption during extended gameplay sessions
   - Benchmark location update frequency against battery usage
   - Test system behavior with multiple simultaneous geofences (10+)
   - Verify performance on low-end devices with limited resources

3. Field Testing:
   - Conduct real-world testing in various environments (urban, rural, indoors)
   - Test in areas with poor GPS reception to verify fallback mechanisms
   - Validate accuracy of distance indicators in different terrains

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify integration with notification system for proximity alerts
   - Test interaction with other location-based game features
   - Ensure proper data synchronization with backend services

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Gather feedback on the intuitiveness of distance indicators
   - Evaluate battery impact perception from test users
   - Assess overall user satisfaction with proximity awareness features
