# Task ID: 55
# Title: Implement Team-Based Protection Zones in PrivateSafeZone System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the PrivateSafeZone functionality to support team-based protection zones, allowing players to create safe areas that automatically protect all members of their team.
# Details:
This task requires significant modifications to the existing PrivateSafeZone system:

1. Extend the PrivateSafeZone class:
   - Add a new 'teamId' field (String or UUID)
   - Add a 'teamMembers' collection (Set<UUID> or similar)
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing individual safe zones
   - Update constructors and builders to support team creation

2. Implement team membership management:
   - Create addTeamMember(UUID playerId) method
   - Create removeTeamMember(UUID playerId) method
   - Add getTeamMembers() method to retrieve all team members
   - Implement appropriate validation (e.g., prevent duplicates, handle non-existent members)

3. Update authorization logic:
   - Modify isPlayerAuthorized(UUID playerId) to check if player is in team
   - Maintain original owner-based authorization as fallback
   - Add appropriate logging for authorization decisions

4. Update SafeZoneService:
   - Add methods for creating team-based zones (createTeamSafeZone)
   - Implement methods to add/remove team members from zones
   - Update existing query methods to support team-based filtering

5. Database changes:
   - Add GSI (Global Secondary Index) on teamId in DynamoDB
   - Create index for efficient queries by team membership
   - Update data access methods to utilize new indices

6. API endpoints:
   - Create POST /safezones/team to create team safe zone
   - Add PUT /safezones/{id}/team/members to manage team membership
   - Implement GET /safezones/team/{teamId} to retrieve team zones
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks

7. Update documentation:
   - Add Javadoc comments to all new methods
   - Update API documentation to reflect new endpoints
   - Document the team-based authorization model

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the team-based protection system:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test PrivateSafeZone class modifications:
     * Verify team member addition/removal works correctly
     * Test isPlayerAuthorized with team members and non-members
     * Ensure backward compatibility with non-team zones
   - Test SafeZoneService:
     * Verify team zone creation with various parameters
     * Test team membership management methods
     * Validate query methods return correct results for team zones

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test DynamoDB interactions:
     * Verify indices work correctly for team-based queries
     * Test performance of team membership lookups
     * Ensure data consistency across operations
   - Test API endpoints:
     * Verify all team-based endpoints return correct responses
     * Test error handling for invalid requests
     * Validate authorization rules are enforced

3. Scenario Tests:
   - Create a team zone and verify all team members are protected
   - Test adding/removing members dynamically affects protection
   - Verify non-team members cannot access team zones
   - Test concurrent operations on team zones

4. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark team zone lookups with varying team sizes
   - Test system under load with many team zones
   - Verify database indices improve query performance

All tests should include both positive cases (expected behavior) and negative cases (error handling, edge cases).
