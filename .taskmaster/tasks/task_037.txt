# Task ID: 37
# Title: Refactor Generic Exception Catches to Specific Exception Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Replace all generic Exception catches in non-handler code with specific exception types to improve error handling, debugging, and code maintainability.
# Details:
This task involves identifying and refactoring all instances where generic Exception classes are caught in non-exception-handler code throughout the codebase. For each occurrence:

1. Analyze the code to determine which specific exceptions could be thrown in the try block
2. Replace the generic catch(Exception e) with multiple specific exception catches (e.g., catch(IOException e), catch(IllegalArgumentException e))
3. Implement appropriate handling for each specific exception type
4. If some exceptions cannot be handled at this level, allow them to propagate up the call stack
5. For truly unexpected exceptions that must be caught, use a more specific approach such as catch(RuntimeException e) with proper logging
6. Add comments explaining the rationale for exception handling choices
7. Ensure proper resource cleanup in finally blocks where appropriate
8. Update any logging to include specific exception details

Focus areas should include:
- Service layer methods
- Repository/DAO implementations
- Utility classes
- Business logic components

Exclude dedicated exception handler classes, global exception handlers, or controller advice classes that are specifically designed to catch and process exceptions.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the refactored code properly handles specific exceptions without changing the overall application behavior:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests that deliberately trigger each specific exception type
   - Verify that exceptions are caught and handled as expected
   - Ensure that uncaught exceptions properly propagate up the call stack
   - Test edge cases where multiple exceptions might be thrown

2. Integration Tests:
   - Run existing integration tests to ensure functionality remains unchanged
   - Add new tests for scenarios where exception handling is critical
   - Verify that error messages and logs contain specific exception information

3. Code Review:
   - Use static analysis tools to verify no generic Exception catches remain in non-handler code
   - Review exception handling patterns for consistency
   - Ensure logging includes appropriate context and stack traces

4. Manual Testing:
   - Test error scenarios in the application to verify user-facing error messages are appropriate
   - Check that the application gracefully handles errors without exposing sensitive information

Success criteria: All generic Exception catches in non-handler code are replaced with specific exception handling, with no regression in application functionality.
