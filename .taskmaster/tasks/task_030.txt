# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Dynamic Scheduled Events System with Purge Periods and Tournament Phases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive scheduled events system that manages periodic safe zone disabling, regional competitions, and a final championship phase for the last 100 players.
# Details:
Create a flexible event scheduling system with the following components:

1. **Event Scheduler Core**:
   - Implement a time-based scheduler that can trigger events at specific intervals or calendar dates
   - Design a configuration system for defining event parameters (duration, affected regions, rules modifications)
   - Create an event state machine to handle transitions between normal gameplay, purge periods, regional competitions, and championship phase

2. **Weekly Purge Period Implementation**:
   - Develop mechanism to temporarily disable all safe zones for a configurable duration (default: 6 hours)
   - Implement warning notifications to all players 24 hours and 1 hour before purge begins
   - Create visual indicators in the game world showing purge countdown and active status
   - Ensure proper state restoration when purge period ends

3. **Regional Sub-competitions**:
   - Implement a system to divide the game world into configurable regions (minimum 4, maximum 12)
   - Create leaderboards and scoring mechanisms specific to each region
   - Design qualification rules for advancing from regional to championship phase
   - Implement region-specific event modifiers (e.g., resource scarcity, environmental hazards)

4. **Championship Phase**:
   - Create a system to identify and select the top 100 players based on regional performance
   - Implement teleportation or migration mechanism to bring qualified players to the championship city
   - Design special rules and constraints for the championship (limited resources, accelerated danger zones)
   - Develop a spectator system for eliminated players to watch the championship
   - Create a victory ceremony and rewards distribution for the winner

5. **Database and Persistence**:
   - Design database schema to store event schedules, player participation, and results
   - Implement transaction handling for critical operations during event transitions
   - Create backup and recovery mechanisms for event state in case of server failures

The system should be highly configurable through admin interfaces and resilient to server restarts or crashes.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the scheduled events system:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test event scheduler timing accuracy with simulated time progression
   - Verify state transitions between different event phases
   - Test boundary conditions for player qualification and elimination
   - Validate database operations for event persistence

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify safe zone disabling/enabling during purge periods
   - Test player notification system for upcoming events
   - Validate regional competition boundaries and scoring
   - Confirm championship qualification logic works correctly
   - Test spectator mode functionality during championship

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Simulate maximum player load during event transitions
   - Measure database performance during high-activity periods
   - Test server resource utilization during championship phase with 100 active players and spectators

4. **Manual Testing Scenarios**:
   - Conduct end-to-end test of a complete event cycle (normal → purge → regional → championship)
   - Verify admin controls can modify event parameters correctly
   - Test recovery from simulated server crashes during critical event phases
   - Validate that event history is properly recorded and queryable

5. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - All scheduled events must trigger within ±1 second of configured time
   - Safe zones must be completely disabled during purge periods
   - Regional competitions must correctly track player performance
   - Championship must successfully gather exactly 100 qualified players
   - System must maintain data integrity through all event transitions
