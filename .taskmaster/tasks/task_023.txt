# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement API Rate Limiting and Security Measures
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive rate limiting, security measures, and abuse prevention for the API.
# Details:
Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints. Add IP-based and token-based throttling. Create security headers and CORS configuration. Implement request validation and sanitization. Add abuse detection for suspicious patterns. Create monitoring and alerting for security events. Implement automated blocking for detected attacks.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate limiting with high-frequency requests. Verify security headers are correctly implemented. Test abuse detection with simulated attack patterns. Verify blocking mechanisms work as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure API Gateway Throttling and Rate Limiting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement multi-level rate limiting using AWS API Gateway throttling capabilities for IP-based and user-based restrictions
### Details:
Configure account-level, stage-level, and method-level throttling in API Gateway. Set up usage plans with API keys for per-client throttling. Implement token bucket algorithm with appropriate burst and rate limits. Configure different throttling settings for critical vs non-critical endpoints. Set up 429 response handling with appropriate retry mechanisms.

## 2. Implement Security Headers and CORS Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Set up proper security headers and CORS policies to protect API endpoints from cross-site attacks and unauthorized access
### Details:
Configure security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security. Implement proper CORS configuration in API Gateway with specific allowed origins, methods, and headers. Set up OPTIONS preflight handling. Ensure secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) for any session cookies.

## 3. Develop Request Validation and Input Sanitization [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive request validation and input sanitization to prevent injection attacks and malformed requests
### Details:
Set up API Gateway request validators for payload, query string, and header validation. Create JSON Schema validation for request bodies. Implement Lambda-based input sanitization for complex validation logic. Add validation for location data to prevent spoofing. Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks. Implement proper error responses for validation failures.

## 4. Create Abuse Detection and Automated Blocking System [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.3
### Description: Develop a system to detect suspicious patterns and automatically block malicious actors
### Details:
Implement Lambda functions to analyze request patterns and detect abuse. Set up DynamoDB tables to track suspicious activities and known malicious IPs/users. Create automated blocking mechanisms using API Gateway resource policies and WAF rules. Develop logic to detect location spoofing specific to the game mechanics. Implement progressive penalties (warnings, temporary blocks, permanent bans) for different abuse levels.

## 5. Set Up Security Monitoring and Alerting [done]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for security events and potential attacks
### Details:
Configure CloudWatch Logs and Metrics for API Gateway and Lambda functions. Set up CloudWatch Alarms for unusual traffic patterns, high error rates, and throttling events. Implement Lambda functions to analyze logs for security patterns. Create SNS topics for security alerts with appropriate routing to team members. Set up a dashboard for security monitoring with key metrics. Configure AWS WAF logging and integrate with existing monitoring.
