# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement API Rate Limiting and Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive rate limiting, security measures, and abuse prevention for the API.
# Details:
Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints. Add IP-based and token-based throttling. Create security headers and CORS configuration. Implement request validation and sanitization. Add abuse detection for suspicious patterns. Create monitoring and alerting for security events. Implement automated blocking for detected attacks.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate limiting with high-frequency requests. Verify security headers are correctly implemented. Test abuse detection with simulated attack patterns. Verify blocking mechanisms work as expected.
