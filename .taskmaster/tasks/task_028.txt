# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Safe Zone System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a multi-tiered safe zone system with public, private, timed, and relocatable zones, including all necessary backend APIs and database models to manage zone interactions and enforce game rules.
# Details:
Create a flexible safe zone system with the following components:

1. Database Models:
   - Base SafeZone model with common properties (coordinates, radius, active status)
   - Specialized models for each zone type:
     - PublicSafeZone: accessible to all players
     - PrivateSafeZone: accessible only to authorized players (store owner_id and authorized_players list)
     - TimedSafeZone: temporary zones with start_time and duration
     - RelocatableSafeZone: zones that can be moved (store movement history and cooldown period)

2. Backend APIs:
   - CRUD operations for each safe zone type
   - Zone authorization endpoints (request/grant access to private zones)
   - Zone status checking endpoint (is_player_in_safe_zone)
   - Zone relocation endpoint with validation
   - Zone timer management (activate/deactivate timed zones)

3. Game Logic Implementation:
   - Spatial indexing for efficient player-zone intersection detection
   - Rule enforcement within zones (disable combat, modify resource gathering rates, etc.)
   - Zone transition handling (entering/exiting effects)
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping zones
   - Notification system for zone status changes

4. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize spatial queries for large numbers of zones
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed zone data
   - Consider using geospatial database features if available

Ensure the system is extensible to allow for future zone types and properties.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test CRUD operations for each zone type
   - Validate zone property constraints (e.g., radius limits, authorization rules)
   - Test zone type-specific logic (timed activation/deactivation, relocation rules)
   - Verify spatial calculations for player-zone intersection

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test API endpoints with various request scenarios
   - Verify database consistency after complex operations
   - Test concurrent zone operations for race conditions

3. Functional Tests:
   - Create test scenarios for each zone type:
     - Public: Verify all players can enter/exit and receive appropriate effects
     - Private: Test authorization flow and access control
     - Timed: Verify automatic activation/deactivation at specified times
     - Relocatable: Test movement constraints, cooldowns, and history tracking
   - Test overlapping zones and priority rules

4. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark zone lookup performance with varying numbers of zones
   - Test system under load with many players entering/exiting zones simultaneously
   - Verify memory usage remains acceptable with large zone datasets

5. Edge Cases:
   - Test zone behavior at world boundaries
   - Verify handling of players disconnecting while in zones
   - Test zone persistence across server restarts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base SafeZone Database Models and Core APIs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational database models for all safe zone types and implement the core API endpoints for basic zone management.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a base SafeZone model with common properties:
   - id (unique identifier)
   - coordinates (latitude/longitude)
   - radius (in meters)
   - active_status (boolean)
   - created_at, updated_at timestamps
   - zone_type (enum: 'public', 'private', 'timed', 'relocatable')

2. Implement specialized models extending the base model:
   - PublicSafeZone: Add properties for public designation
   - PrivateSafeZone: Add owner_id and authorized_players (array/relation)
   - TimedSafeZone: Add start_time and duration fields
   - RelocatableSafeZone: Add movement_history and cooldown_period

3. Create database migrations and set up appropriate indexes

4. Implement core API endpoints:
   - GET /safe-zones (list all zones with filtering)
   - GET /safe-zones/:id (get zone details)
   - POST /safe-zones (create new zone with validation)
   - PUT /safe-zones/:id (update zone properties)
   - DELETE /safe-zones/:id (remove zone)

5. Add basic validation logic for each zone type

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for model validations and constraints
- API endpoint tests with mock data
- Test database schema integrity
- Verify proper inheritance between models

## 2. Implement Specialized Zone Type APIs and Authorization [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Build specialized API endpoints for each zone type and implement the authorization system for private zones.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the base API with specialized endpoints for each zone type:
   - POST /safe-zones/public (create public zone)
   - POST /safe-zones/private (create private zone)
   - POST /safe-zones/timed (create timed zone)
   - POST /safe-zones/relocatable (create relocatable zone)

2. Implement private zone authorization system:
   - POST /safe-zones/:id/authorize (add player to authorized list)
   - DELETE /safe-zones/:id/authorize/:player_id (remove authorization)
   - GET /safe-zones/:id/authorized-players (list authorized players)

3. Implement timed zone management:
   - POST /safe-zones/:id/activate (manually activate a timed zone)
   - POST /safe-zones/:id/deactivate (manually deactivate a timed zone)
   - Create background job for automatic activation/deactivation

4. Implement relocatable zone functionality:
   - POST /safe-zones/:id/relocate (move zone to new coordinates)
   - GET /safe-zones/:id/movement-history (view past locations)
