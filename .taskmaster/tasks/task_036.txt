# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for DynamoDbNotificationDao
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a complete suite of unit tests for the DynamoDbNotificationDao class to ensure all methods and edge cases are properly covered.
# Details:
This task involves implementing unit tests for all remaining methods in the DynamoDbNotificationDao class that currently lack test coverage. The developer should:

1. Review existing test coverage to identify untested methods and edge cases
2. Create test cases for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
3. Implement tests for error handling scenarios including:
   - DynamoDB service exceptions
   - Item not found scenarios
   - Permission/access issues
   - Malformed data handling
4. Test pagination functionality if applicable
5. Test any filtering or query capabilities
6. Verify proper handling of notification status transitions
7. Test batch operations if supported
8. Use mocking frameworks (like Mockito) to isolate the DAO from actual DynamoDB dependencies
9. Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on execution order
10. Add appropriate assertions to verify both successful operations and proper error handling

# Test Strategy:
Verification will involve:

1. Code review to ensure all public methods have corresponding test methods
2. Verify test coverage metrics using JaCoCo or similar tools, aiming for >90% line coverage
3. Confirm tests for the following scenarios exist:
   - Successfully saving a notification
   - Retrieving a notification by ID
   - Retrieving notifications by user ID
   - Updating notification status
   - Deleting notifications
   - Handling of null/invalid inputs
   - Proper exception propagation
4. Run the entire test suite to ensure all tests pass consistently
5. Verify that tests use appropriate mocking to avoid actual DynamoDB calls
6. Check that edge cases are covered (empty results, maximum items, etc.)
7. Ensure tests are well-documented with clear assertions explaining expected outcomes
