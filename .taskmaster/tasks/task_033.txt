# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Strategy for Assassin Game Platform
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive disaster recovery solution across multiple AWS regions to ensure high availability and business continuity for the Assassin game platform during regional outages.
# Details:
Implement a multi-region disaster recovery strategy with the following components:

1. Architecture Configuration:
   - Set up an active-active configuration across at least two AWS regions (e.g., us-east-1 and us-west-2)
   - Configure Route 53 with health checks and DNS failover routing policies
   - Implement Global Accelerator for improved network performance across regions

2. Data Replication Strategy:
   - Configure DynamoDB global tables for game state and user data with multi-region replication
   - Set up cross-region replication for S3 buckets containing static assets
   - Implement database replication with minimal RPO (Recovery Point Objective) using RDS Multi-AZ with cross-region read replicas or Aurora Global Database
   - Ensure consistent data synchronization with appropriate conflict resolution mechanisms

3. Failover Mechanisms:
   - Create automated failover procedures using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch alarms
   - Implement health checks to detect regional failures
   - Develop scripts for automated traffic redirection during outages
   - Set RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of less than 15 minutes for critical services

4. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Set up cross-region monitoring using CloudWatch Synthetics
   - Configure SNS alerts for failover events and service degradation
   - Implement logging across regions with centralized log aggregation

5. Documentation and Procedures:
   - Create detailed runbooks for both automated and manual failover procedures
   - Document recovery processes and regional dependencies
   - Develop a communication plan for stakeholders during DR events

Considerations:
- Ensure compliance with data sovereignty requirements across regions
- Optimize for cost while maintaining required redundancy
- Address latency implications for game performance in different regions
- Consider session persistence during failover events

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the effectiveness of the disaster recovery strategy through:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify data replication works correctly by creating test data in the primary region and confirming it appears in secondary regions within defined RPO
   - Test Route 53 health checks and DNS failover by simulating endpoint failures
   - Validate that application components function correctly in each region independently

2. Disaster Recovery Drills:
   - Conduct scheduled DR drills by simulating a complete regional outage
   - Execute both automated and manual failover procedures
   - Measure actual RTO and RPO achieved during tests against defined objectives
   - Test failback procedures to return to normal operations

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure application performance in each region to ensure consistent user experience
   - Test latency for users connecting from different geographic locations
   - Verify that game functionality works with acceptable performance in failover scenarios

4. Chaos Engineering:
   - Implement controlled chaos experiments using tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator
   - Randomly terminate instances or services to verify automatic recovery
   - Simulate network partitions between regions

5. Validation Metrics:
   - Document RTO: time to restore service functionality (target: <15 minutes)
   - Document RPO: amount of data loss during failover (target: <5 minutes)
   - Measure user impact: percentage of failed requests during transition
   - Track cost implications of the multi-region setup

All tests should be documented with results compared against defined SLAs, with remediation plans for any gaps identified.
