# Task ID: 59
# Title: Create Game Type Plugin System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Design and implement a plugin architecture that allows multiple game types to be supported through a standardized system with interfaces for GameTypePlugin, PlayerAction, GameEvent, and WinCondition.
# Details:
1. Design the core plugin interfaces:
   - GameTypePlugin: Main interface that defines a game type with initialization, configuration, and lifecycle methods
   - PlayerAction: Interface for defining valid player actions in a game type
   - GameEvent: Interface for game events that can occur during gameplay
   - WinCondition: Interface for determining when and how a game ends

2. Implement the plugin registry and loader:
   - Create a PluginRegistry class to manage available game type plugins
   - Implement dynamic loading of plugins from a designated directory
   - Add versioning support for plugins to handle compatibility

3. Refactor existing Assassin game logic to use the plugin system:
   - Convert current game mechanics to implement the new interfaces
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing games

4. Create base implementations for common game elements:
   - AbstractGameTypePlugin: Base class with common functionality
   - StandardPlayerActions: Common actions across game types
   - CoreGameEvents: Events shared by multiple game types

5. Implement specific game type plugins:
   - AssassinGamePlugin: Traditional elimination gameplay
   - CaptureTheFlagPlugin: Team-based flag capture gameplay
   - WorldHeistPlugin: Objective-based gameplay with item collection

6. Update game creation and management to support plugin selection:
   - Modify game creation endpoints to specify game type
   - Add configuration options specific to each game type
   - Implement plugin-specific validation rules

7. Integrate with existing systems:
   - Connect plugins to leaderboard and achievement systems
   - Ensure social features work across game types
   - Update notification system to handle game-specific events

8. Create documentation for plugin development:
   - API documentation for all interfaces
   - Example implementations
   - Best practices for plugin development

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each interface and base implementation
   - Test plugin loading and registration mechanisms
   - Verify proper initialization and configuration of plugins

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with existing systems (leaderboards, social features, notifications)
   - Verify that game creation works with different plugin types
   - Test game lifecycle events across different game types

3. Plugin Implementation Testing:
   - Create test implementations of each game type plugin
   - Verify that game-specific rules are properly enforced
   - Test win conditions and game completion for each type

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure overhead of plugin system compared to direct implementation
   - Test with multiple concurrent games of different types
   - Verify scalability with many registered plugins

5. Backward Compatibility Testing:
   - Ensure existing Assassin games continue to function
   - Verify that historical data remains accessible and correct

6. Plugin Development Testing:
   - Create a test plugin following documentation
   - Verify that third-party plugins can be developed and integrated
   - Test plugin versioning and compatibility checks

7. End-to-End Testing:
   - Run complete game scenarios for each game type
   - Test transitions between different game states
   - Verify correct behavior of game-specific features

8. Security Testing:
   - Verify that plugins cannot access unauthorized data
   - Test input validation for plugin-specific configuration
   - Ensure plugins cannot compromise system integrity
