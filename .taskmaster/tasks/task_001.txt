# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Base Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None

# Description: Initialize the project repository with the basic folder structure, configuration files, and dependencies for the Assassin Game API.
# Details:
Create a new repository with appropriate .gitignore and README.md. Set up the project structure following RESTful architecture principles. Initialize package.json with required dependencies including Express.js for the API server, MongoDB/Mongoose for database, authentication libraries, geolocation libraries, and testing frameworks.
