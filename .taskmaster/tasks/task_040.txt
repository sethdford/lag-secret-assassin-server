# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Interactive Game Map with Real-time Location Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive mapping system that visualizes game state, player locations, and zone information with real-time updates and appropriate privacy controls.
# Details:
Integrate a mapping service (Google Maps API, Mapbox, or similar) to create an interactive game visualization system with the following components:

1. Map Visualization Layer:
   - Implement color-coded overlays for safe zones (green), danger zones (red), and neutral areas (yellow)
   - Create heatmap visualization showing player activity density without revealing exact positions
   - Add toggle controls to show/hide different map elements (zones, heatmaps, etc.)
   - Ensure responsive design works across desktop and mobile devices

2. Real-time Location Tracking:
   - Implement secure geolocation tracking using browser geolocation API or native app location services
   - Create a location update service that sends position data at configurable intervals (15-60 seconds)
   - Implement privacy controls allowing players to temporarily mask exact location or appear offline
   - Add visual indicators showing player movement direction and speed when appropriate

3. Backend Geospatial Services:
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for proximity queries (e.g., /api/v1/proximity?radius=100m)
   - Implement geofencing to detect when players enter/exit designated zones
   - Set up database schema optimized for geospatial queries (using PostGIS or MongoDB geospatial indexes)
   - Create caching layer to handle high-volume location update requests

4. Admin and Analysis Views:
   - Build separate admin interface showing all player positions in real-time
   - Implement game progress timeline with playback controls for reviewing game events
   - Create historical data visualization showing kill locations with timestamp filtering
   - Add export functionality for post-game analysis data

5. Security Considerations:
   - Implement rate limiting on location update API to prevent tracking abuse
   - Ensure location data is encrypted in transit and at rest
   - Create audit logging for all location data access
   - Design system to minimize battery impact on mobile devices

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify map renders correctly across different browsers and devices
   - Confirm zone overlays appear with correct colors and boundaries
   - Test that player location updates appear on the map within 5 seconds of movement
   - Validate that privacy controls correctly mask or hide player locations when activated

2. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark map loading time (should be under 3 seconds on standard connections)
   - Test system with simulated load of 100+ simultaneous players updating locations
   - Verify geospatial queries return results in under 200ms
   - Monitor client-side memory usage during extended map sessions

3. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on location API endpoints
   - Verify that player location data cannot be accessed by unauthorized users
   - Test rate limiting by sending excessive location update requests
   - Validate that historical location data is properly anonymized when appropriate

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for game organizers to monitor a simulated game
   - Have test players verify the accuracy of their displayed positions
   - Confirm heatmaps accurately reflect areas of player concentration
   - Validate that kill location visualization correctly displays historical events

5. Integration Testing:
   - Verify map system integrates with user authentication system
   - Test that game event triggers (kills, zone changes) correctly update map visualization
   - Confirm admin views properly display all required game state information
   - Validate that exported data contains all necessary information for analysis
