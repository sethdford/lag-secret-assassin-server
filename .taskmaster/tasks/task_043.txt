# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement Shrinking Safe Zone Gameplay Mode
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a new gameplay mode where the safe playable area gradually shrinks over time, damaging players who remain outside the boundaries. This implements the shrinking zone mechanics specified in functional requirement FR-1.5.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive system for the shrinking safe zone gameplay mode with the following components:

1. Zone Configuration System:
   - Define a configurable set of shrinking stages (minimum 3-5 stages)
   - For each stage, specify: duration, final zone size, transition time, and damage amount
   - Create a visual indicator for the current safe zone and the next zone boundary

2. Zone State Management:
   - Implement a state machine to handle zone transitions (Waiting, Shrinking, Stable)
   - Create a timer system to manage stage progression
   - Develop smooth interpolation for zone shrinking animations
   - Ensure the zone center can be randomized or predetermined

3. Player Damage System:
   - Implement a system to detect players outside the safe zone
   - Apply configurable damage over time to players outside the zone
   - Add visual and audio feedback when players take zone damage
   - Include a grace period when a new zone is announced before damage begins

4. Game Integration:
   - Add the new mode to the game mode selection UI
   - Implement proper initialization and cleanup for the mode
   - Create appropriate UI elements showing zone timer, current stage, and warning indicators
   - Ensure the mode works with existing game systems (respawn, scoring, etc.)

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize zone boundary calculations to minimize performance impact
   - Use efficient player position checking methods
   - Consider level of detail adjustments for zone visualization at distance

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the shrinking safe zone gameplay mode:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify zone shrinks correctly according to configured parameters
   - Confirm damage is applied at the correct rate to players outside the zone
   - Test zone state transitions occur at the expected times
   - Validate visual indicators accurately represent current and next zone boundaries

2. Edge Cases:
   - Test behavior when players are exactly on the zone boundary
   - Verify correct behavior when players rapidly enter and exit the zone
   - Test with minimum and maximum configured zone sizes
   - Validate behavior when all players are outside the zone

3. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the mode works correctly with different maps and player counts
   - Test interaction with other game systems (scoring, respawn, etc.)
   - Confirm UI elements update correctly as the zone changes

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure frame rate impact with maximum player count
   - Profile memory usage during extended gameplay sessions
   - Test on minimum specification hardware to ensure acceptable performance

5. Playtest Scenarios:
   - Organize playtests with different zone configurations
   - Gather feedback on pacing, difficulty, and fun factor
   - Verify the mode creates the intended tension and strategic gameplay

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add API Endpoints for Zone State (Optional) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add API endpoints if necessary to query the current shrinking zone state (center, radius, timer).
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-24T22:36:58.058Z>
The Zone State API endpoints have been fully implemented and tested. The implementation includes:

COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:
- ZoneStateHandler.java with two main endpoints:
  - GET /games/{gameId}/zone/state: Returns detailed zone state including center, radius, phase, timers, and stage info
  - GET /games/{gameId}/zone/status: Returns simplified zone status summary for client UI
- Comprehensive error handling for missing games, disabled zones, and invalid states
- Full integration with ShrinkingZoneService for state management
- Complete test coverage in ZoneStateHandlerTest.java with 11 test scenarios
- Proper API Gateway integration defined in template.yaml

ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY:
- Both endpoints check if shrinking zone is enabled for the game
- /zone/state endpoint calls advanceZoneState() to ensure current state is up-to-date
- /zone/status endpoint provides simplified view for UI display
- Proper error responses (404, 400, 500) with meaningful messages
- JSON response format with all necessary zone information

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing codebase.

## 2. Update Location Checks for Shrinking Zone [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Modify LocationService and potentially SafeZoneService to check against the dynamic shrinking zone for applicable game modes.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-06-03T11:28:07.210Z>
Successfully implemented shrinking zone integration in LocationService and SafeZoneService.

COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:

LocationService Updates:
- Added ShrinkingZoneService dependency with proper constructor injection
- Integrated shrinking zone checking in updatePlayerLocation() method  
- Added checkShrinkingZoneBoundary() method to detect zone violations
- Added isPlayerTakingZoneDamage() public method for damage system integration
- Created ShrinkingZoneEvent class for zone boundary events
- Logs player zone status (inside/outside) with distance and radius details

SafeZoneService Updates:
- Added ShrinkingZoneService dependency with constructor updates
- Added isPlayerCurrentlySafe() method that considers both traditional safe zones AND shrinking zone
- Added isLocationSafeForPlayer() method for movement planning
- Comprehensive safety logic: player is safe if in traditional safe zone OR inside current shrinking zone
- Proper error handling and logging for zone state issues

Key Integration Points:
- Uses ShrinkingZoneService.advanceZoneState() to get current zone state
- Calculates distance using GeoUtils.calculateDistance() 
- Checks zone boundaries using center coordinates and radius
- Only applies zone logic when shrinking zone is enabled for the game
- Respects zone phases (no damage during WAITING phase)

The implementation is ready for the next subtasks: zone state machine integration (43.3) and time advancement (43.4). The foundation for damage application outside zones is also established.

## 4. Implement Time Advancement and Stage Triggering [done]
### Dependencies: 43.3
### Description: Decide on and implement a mechanism (e.g., scheduled Lambda, opportunistic updates) to advance zone stages based on timers.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-06-05T12:26:24.529Z>
Task 43.4 is COMPLETE. The time advancement and stage triggering mechanism for the shrinking safe zone gameplay mode has been fully implemented with robust scheduled and opportunistic update strategies. This includes a scheduled Lambda function (ZoneUpdateHandler) triggered every minute via CloudWatch Events, real-time zone state advancement logic with precise timestamp handling, and seamless integration with player interactions to ensure immediate state accuracy. Player damage processing outside the safe zone is now automated and time-based, with elimination thresholds and detailed tracking. All infrastructure, permissions, and monitoring are configured for fault tolerance, scalability, and resource efficiency. The system now guarantees both reliable scheduled progression and real-time responsiveness for the shrinking zone feature.
