   - Implement a matchmaking system that considers geographic proximity
   - Create a server selection algorithm that balances load and latency
   - Design a data synchronization protocol between regional servers
   - Implement region failover mechanisms

Technical constraints:
- Maximum acceptable latency: 100ms for action games, 200ms for turn-based games
- System must maintain 99.9% uptime during peak hours
- Database writes should complete in under 50ms
- Solution must be cloud-agnostic or support at least two major cloud providers

# Test Strategy:
Testing will be conducted in multiple phases to ensure the system meets all requirements:

1. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate 1,000+ concurrent connections using tools like JMeter or Locust
   - Gradually increase load to 2,000+ connections to test scaling capabilities
   - Measure response times under various load conditions
   - Verify auto-scaling triggers work correctly when thresholds are reached

2. **Latency Testing**:
   - Deploy test clients in different geographic regions
   - Measure and record round-trip times between clients and servers
   - Verify latency remains under 100ms for 95% of connections
   - Test latency compensation algorithms with artificially introduced network delays

3. **Database Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark read/write operations under high concurrency
   - Verify sharding strategy effectively distributes load
   - Test database failover scenarios
   - Measure cache hit rates and optimize as needed

4. **Regional Distribution Testing**:
   - Verify players are correctly routed to optimal regional servers
   - Test cross-region gameplay scenarios
   - Simulate regional server failures to verify failover mechanisms
   - Measure data synchronization times between regions

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Run end-to-end gameplay scenarios with clients in multiple regions
   - Verify game state consistency across all connected clients
   - Test matchmaking with players from different regions

6. **Chaos Testing**:
   - Randomly terminate server instances to test resilience
   - Introduce network partitions between regions
   - Simulate database failures
   - Verify system recovers automatically from all failure scenarios

Success criteria: System maintains stable gameplay with 1,000+ concurrent users across at least 5 geographic regions with latency under 100ms for 95% of connections.
