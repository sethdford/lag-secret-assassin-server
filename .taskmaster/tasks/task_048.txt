# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Distributed Tracing with AWS X-Ray
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement end-to-end request tracking using AWS X-Ray to monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and map service dependencies across the serverless architecture.
# Details:
Based on requirement TC-3.3, implement distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray across all Lambda functions and services:

1. Enable X-Ray tracing for all Lambda functions by updating their configuration in the infrastructure code
2. Implement the AWS X-Ray SDK in each Lambda function:
   - Add the AWS X-Ray SDK as a dependency in package.json
   - Initialize the X-Ray SDK in each Lambda handler
   - Configure sampling rules appropriate for the application's traffic patterns
3. Add request annotations to capture important business data:
   - Include user IDs, transaction types, and other relevant metadata
   - Ensure PII is not included in annotations
4. Create custom subsegments for critical operations:
   - Database queries
   - External API calls
   - File processing operations
   - Any computation-heavy processes
5. Implement service maps to visualize dependencies between components:
   - Configure proper naming for all segments
   - Ensure all service connections are properly captured
6. Set up error and exception tracking:
   - Capture and annotate errors in traces
   - Include error types and messages in segments
7. Configure X-Ray groups and filter expressions for different service components
8. Create CloudWatch dashboards that incorporate X-Ray metrics and traces
9. Document the tracing implementation and how to interpret the results

Ensure that the implementation has minimal performance impact while providing comprehensive visibility into the application's behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Testing strategy for X-Ray implementation:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify X-Ray daemon is properly configured and running
   - Confirm traces are being generated for each Lambda invocation
   - Validate that custom subsegments are created for all critical operations
   - Check that annotations contain the expected metadata

2. Integration Testing:
   - Execute end-to-end workflows and verify complete trace chains are created
   - Confirm service dependencies are correctly mapped in the X-Ray console
   - Test that traces properly connect across service boundaries

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the overhead introduced by X-Ray tracing
   - Verify that sampling rules are working as expected under load
   - Ensure tracing doesn't significantly impact application response times

4. Error Scenario Testing:
   - Deliberately trigger errors and exceptions to verify they're properly captured
   - Confirm error annotations include sufficient detail for troubleshooting

5. Dashboard Validation:
   - Verify CloudWatch dashboards correctly display X-Ray metrics
   - Confirm trace data can be effectively queried and analyzed

6. Manual Verification:
   - In the AWS X-Ray console, manually inspect traces for several test transactions
   - Verify the service map accurately represents the application architecture
   - Confirm that performance bottlenecks can be identified using the trace data
