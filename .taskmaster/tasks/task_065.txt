# Task ID: 65
# Title: Implement Capture The Flag Game Plugin
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 64
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a complete Capture The Flag game type plugin with team-based gameplay, flag capture mechanics, scoring system, and respawn functionality that integrates with the game type plugin architecture.
# Details:
1. Design the CTF game plugin architecture:
   - Create a `CaptureTheFlagPlugin` class that implements the `GameTypePlugin` interface
   - Define CTF-specific configuration schema (team count, flag locations, respawn times, win conditions)
   - Implement game initialization logic that sets up team assignments and flag positions

2. Implement team-based player state management:
   - Extend the universal player state with CTF-specific attributes:
     - `teamId`: Player's assigned team
     - `hasFlagId`: ID of flag currently carried (null if none)
     - `isRespawning`: Boolean indicating respawn state
     - `respawnTimestamp`: When player will respawn
     - `captureCount`: Number of successful flag captures
     - `position`: Current player location (for proximity calculations)

3. Create CTF-specific player actions:
   - `PickupFlagAction`: When player is in proximity to opponent's flag
   - `DropFlagAction`: Voluntarily drop a carried flag
   - `CaptureAction`: Return to base with opponent's flag
   - `EliminatePlayerAction`: Remove opponent from play (forcing respawn)
   - `RespawnAction`: Return to play after elimination

4. Implement CTF game events:
   - `FlagPickupEvent`: When a player picks up a flag
   - `FlagDroppedEvent`: When a flag is dropped (voluntary or via elimination)
   - `FlagCapturedEvent`: When a flag is successfully captured
   - `PlayerEliminatedEvent`: When a player is eliminated
   - `PlayerRespawnedEvent`: When a player respawns
   - `TeamScoreChangedEvent`: When a team's score changes

5. Develop CTF game logic handlers:
   - Flag pickup validation (must be at opponent's flag location)
   - Flag capture validation (must be at own base with opponent's flag)
   - Player elimination logic (drops flag if carrying)
   - Respawn timer and location management
   - Team score calculation and updates

6. Implement win conditions:
   - First team to X captures (configurable)
   - Highest score after time limit (configurable)
   - Create `CTFWinCondition` class implementing the `WinCondition` interface

7. Create CTF-specific UI components:
   - Team assignment display
   - Flag status indicators (at base, carried by player, dropped)
   - Team score display
   - Respawn timer countdown
   - Game timer and win condition progress

8. Implement CTF map and location services:
   - Define flag base locations
   - Create respawn point locations for each team
   - Implement proximity detection for flag pickup/capture

9. Add CTF-specific leaderboard metrics:
   - Individual flag captures
   - Flag carrier eliminations
   - Time as flag carrier
   - Successful defenses

10. Integrate with the game type configuration system:
    - Register CTF plugin with the plugin system
    - Create default configuration templates
    - Implement configuration validation logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test CTF plugin initialization with various configurations
   - Verify team assignment logic distributes players evenly
   - Test flag pickup validation logic with valid and invalid scenarios
   - Test flag capture validation with valid and invalid scenarios
   - Verify player elimination and respawn timing logic
   - Test win condition evaluation for different game configurations

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test CTF plugin registration with the game type plugin system
   - Verify CTF configuration schema validation
   - Test event propagation for all CTF-specific events
   - Verify state transitions through complete game flows
   - Test interaction between player actions and game state updates

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create a simulated CTF game with multiple players
   - Test complete flag capture scenarios from pickup to score
   - Verify elimination and respawn functionality in live game
   - Test win condition triggering and game completion
   - Verify leaderboard updates after game completion

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure event processing latency with many simultaneous players
   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent CTF games
   - Verify database performance with high-frequency state updates

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct playtests with real users in controlled environments
   - Gather feedback on game balance and mechanics
   - Verify UI clarity and responsiveness
   - Test on various device types and network conditions

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify existing Assassin game type still functions correctly
   - Ensure leaderboard and achievement systems work with CTF
   - Test social features integration with team-based gameplay
