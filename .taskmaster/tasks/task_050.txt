# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement EventBridge/DynamoDB Stream Triggers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure DynamoDB Streams and EventBridge rules to trigger Lambda functions for asynchronous event-based processing in the Assassin Game application.
# Details:
This task involves setting up event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous processing for key game events:

1. **DynamoDB Streams Configuration**:
   - Enable DynamoDB Streams on relevant tables (Players, Games, Kills)
   - Configure stream view type to include both old and new images
   - Set appropriate batch size and retry policies

2. **Lambda Trigger Functions**:
   - Create Lambda functions for these event types:
     a. Player Status Changes: Trigger target reassignment when a player is eliminated or deactivated
     b. Kill Verification Events: Process confirmed kills and update game state
     c. Game State Updates: Send notifications to players about game events

3. **EventBridge Rules**:
   - Create rules to route events to appropriate Lambda functions
   - Implement filtering patterns to process only relevant events
   - Set up dead-letter queues for failed event processing

4. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**:
   - Implement idempotent Lambda functions to handle duplicate events
   - Add appropriate error handling with structured logging
   - Configure retry policies with exponential backoff

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for failed invocations
   - Create metrics for event processing latency

Ensure all Lambda functions follow the principle of least privilege with appropriate IAM permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the end-to-end event processing flow:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for each Lambda function using mocked event data
   - Test error handling paths and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create test harness to trigger actual DynamoDB changes and verify Lambda execution
   - Verify correct event data is passed to Lambda functions
   - Test event filtering logic in EventBridge rules

3. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Player Elimination: Update player status to 'eliminated' and verify target reassignment occurs
   - Kill Verification: Submit kill event and verify game state updates correctly
   - Game State Change: Update game status and verify notifications are sent
   - Concurrency: Test multiple simultaneous events to verify correct handling
   - Failure Scenarios: Test retry logic by forcing Lambda failures

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and document event processing latency
   - Test with batch events to verify scaling behavior

5. **Monitoring Verification**:
   - Verify CloudWatch alarms trigger correctly on failures
   - Confirm metrics are recording accurately

Document all test results with evidence of successful event processing.
