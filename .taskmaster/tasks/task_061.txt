# Task ID: 61
# Title: Develop Event-Driven Game Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59, 60
# Priority: low
# Description: Transform the current direct service call architecture into an event-driven system where player actions generate events that are processed by game-type-specific handlers.
# Details:
1. Design the core event system architecture:
   - Create a base `GameEvent` abstract class with common properties (eventId, timestamp, gameId, playerId)
   - Implement `PlayerActionEvent` class extending GameEvent for player-initiated actions
   - Implement `ObjectiveCompletionEvent` class for tracking game objectives
   - Design additional event types as needed (GameStateChangeEvent, AdminActionEvent)

2. Implement the event publishing mechanism:
   - Create an EventPublisher service that handles event creation and distribution
   - Integrate with AWS EventBridge for scalable event processing
   - Implement event serialization/deserialization for persistence and transmission
   - Add event validation to ensure events contain required data

3. Develop the event handling framework:
   - Create an EventHandler interface that game type plugins must implement
   - Implement routing logic to direct events to appropriate game type handlers
   - Add support for event filtering based on event type and properties
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for failed event processing

4. Refactor existing service calls to use the event system:
   - Convert direct method calls to event publishing
   - Update the PlayerAction interface from the plugin system to generate events
   - Modify game state updates to be triggered by events
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition

5. Implement event persistence:
   - Store events in a database for audit trails and replay capability
   - Add indexing for efficient event querying
   - Implement event archiving for completed games

6. Add monitoring and debugging tools:
   - Create endpoints for viewing event streams
   - Implement logging for event processing
   - Add metrics for event throughput and processing times

7. Optimize for performance:
   - Implement batching for high-volume events
   - Add caching for frequently accessed event data
   - Configure appropriate scaling policies for event processors

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each event class to verify proper initialization and data handling
   - Test event serialization/deserialization to ensure data integrity
   - Verify event validation logic correctly identifies invalid events
   - Test event handlers with mock events to ensure proper processing

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test environment with EventBridge integration
   - Verify events flow correctly from publishers to handlers
   - Test event persistence and retrieval
   - Validate that game state changes correctly in response to events
   - Test concurrent event processing to ensure thread safety

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure event throughput under various load conditions
   - Test system behavior with high event volumes
   - Verify scaling policies activate appropriately under load
   - Measure and optimize event processing latency

4. Functional Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for each game type to verify event handling
   - Test the complete flow from player action to state change
   - Verify that different game types handle the same event types appropriately
   - Test error conditions and recovery mechanisms

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality continues to work with the new event system
   - Verify that game outcomes remain consistent after the architecture change
   - Test backward compatibility with any external systems

6. Monitoring Verification:
   - Verify that monitoring tools correctly capture event metrics
   - Test alerting for event processing failures
   - Validate that event logs contain sufficient information for debugging
