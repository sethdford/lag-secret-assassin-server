# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Scaling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6, 20, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize API performance and implement scaling solutions to meet technical requirements.
# Details:
Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data. Add database indexing for performance optimization. Create horizontal scaling for all services. Implement load balancing across multiple regions. Add performance monitoring and alerting. Create auto-scaling based on load metrics. Implement query optimization for complex operations. Add connection pooling for database efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load testing to verify performance under high load. Test scaling with simulated traffic spikes. Verify response times meet requirements (<200ms for 95% of requests). Test failover mechanisms and disaster recovery procedures.
