# Task ID: 60
# Title: Implement Universal Player State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59
# Priority: low
# Description: Replace the current Assassin-specific player state with a flexible, universal player state system that can accommodate different game types using a Map-based storage system.
# Details:
1. Design the universal player state architecture:
   - Create a PlayerState interface that defines the core methods for state management
   - Implement a MapBasedPlayerState class that uses a Map<String, Object> for storing arbitrary game-specific state
   - Define standard methods for getting/setting state values with type safety

2. Refactor existing Assassin-specific player state:
   - Migrate targetPlayerId and kills from direct properties to the new state map
   - Update all references to these properties throughout the codebase
   - Ensure backward compatibility during the transition

3. Implement state management utilities:
   - Create helper methods for common state operations (increment counters, toggle flags, etc.)
   - Add serialization/deserialization support for persistence
   - Implement state validation mechanisms for game-specific requirements

4. Create game-specific state adapters:
   - Develop an AssassinStateAdapter that provides typed access to Assassin-specific state
   - Create a CTFStateAdapter for Capture The Flag team assignments and flags
   - Implement a WorldHeistStateAdapter for role assignments and objectives
   - Design an extensible pattern for future game types to define their state requirements

5. Update the player service layer:
   - Modify PlayerService to use the new state management system
   - Update database operations to store and retrieve the map-based state
   - Implement efficient state update operations that only modify changed values

6. Integrate with the game type plugin system:
   - Add methods for game type plugins to define and initialize required player state
   - Implement state transition hooks for game lifecycle events
   - Create state cleanup mechanisms for when games end

7. Add state change notification system:
   - Implement observers for state changes to trigger game events
   - Create a state change history for auditing and debugging
   - Add support for conditional state changes based on game rules

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for the MapBasedPlayerState class verifying proper storage and retrieval of different data types
   - Test type conversion and validation mechanisms
   - Verify state serialization/deserialization works correctly
   - Test all helper methods and utilities for state manipulation

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the integration with the database layer to ensure proper persistence
   - Verify that the state system works correctly with the game type plugin system
   - Test state transitions during different game lifecycle events
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing Assassin game functionality

3. Migration Verification:
   - Create tests that compare the behavior of the old and new state systems
   - Verify that all existing functionality continues to work with the new system
   - Test performance to ensure the new system doesn't introduce significant overhead

4. Game-Specific Tests:
   - Create test scenarios for each supported game type (Assassin, CTF, World Heist)
   - Verify that game-specific adapters correctly handle their state requirements
   - Test edge cases like state conflicts or invalid state combinations

5. System Tests:
   - Run end-to-end tests simulating complete game flows with the new state system
   - Test concurrent state modifications to ensure thread safety
   - Verify that state change notifications trigger appropriate game events

6. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark state access and modification operations
   - Test with large numbers of players to ensure scalability
   - Measure memory usage compared to the previous implementation
