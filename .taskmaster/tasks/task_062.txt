# Task ID: 62
# Title: Migrate Assassin Logic to Plugin Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59, 60, 61
# Priority: low
# Description: Refactor the current Assassin game implementation to work within the new plugin system by creating an AssassinGamePlugin that implements the GameTypePlugin interface while maintaining all existing functionality.
# Details:
1. Create a new AssassinGamePlugin class that implements the GameTypePlugin interface:
   - Implement required initialization, configuration, and lifecycle methods
   - Define Assassin-specific PlayerAction implementations (e.g., EliminateTargetAction, VerifyEliminationAction)
   - Define Assassin-specific GameEvent implementations (e.g., TargetAssignedEvent, PlayerEliminatedEvent)
   - Implement Assassin-specific WinCondition (LastPlayerStanding)

2. Refactor existing services to work within the plugin architecture:
   - Convert KillService to use the event-driven architecture, emitting appropriate events
   - Refactor TargetAssignmentService to work with the universal player state system
   - Update EliminationVerificationService to use the plugin system's verification framework
   - Ensure all services properly interact with the event system rather than direct method calls

3. Implement data migration strategy:
   - Create adapters for existing Assassin game data to be compatible with the new universal player state
   - Implement backward compatibility layer to ensure existing games continue to function
   - Add data migration scripts for converting existing database records to the new format

4. Update API endpoints:
   - Modify existing Assassin-specific endpoints to route through the plugin system
   - Ensure all responses maintain the same format for backward compatibility
   - Add appropriate documentation for any changes in request/response handling

5. Implement plugin registration:
   - Register AssassinGamePlugin with the plugin system at application startup
   - Configure default game settings and parameters
   - Set up appropriate event listeners and handlers

6. Handle edge cases:
   - Games in progress during migration
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Partial updates and system downtime considerations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the AssassinGamePlugin class, verifying it correctly implements the GameTypePlugin interface
   - Test each refactored service individually to ensure they maintain the same business logic
   - Verify event emission and handling for all Assassin game actions
   - Test the backward compatibility layer with mock data

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete flow of an Assassin game through the plugin system
   - Verify target assignment works correctly with the universal player state
   - Test elimination verification through the new event-driven architecture
   - Ensure leaderboard and achievement integration continues to function

3. Migration Testing:
   - Create test cases with existing game data and verify correct migration
   - Test in-progress games to ensure they continue functioning after migration
   - Verify historical data remains accessible and correctly formatted

4. Regression Testing:
   - Run existing API tests against the refactored endpoints
   - Compare responses from old and new implementations to ensure consistency
   - Verify all existing client applications continue to function without modification

5. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark the new implementation against the old one
   - Test system performance under load with multiple concurrent games
   - Verify event processing doesn't introduce significant latency

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have QA team play complete Assassin games using the new implementation
   - Verify all game mechanics function as expected
   - Ensure the player experience remains unchanged
