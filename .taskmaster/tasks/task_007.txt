# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Target Assignment System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the system for assigning targets to players and managing the chain of assignments throughout the game.
# Details:
Implement algorithms for fair and random target assignment based on game theory principles. Create functionality for reassigning targets when players are eliminated. Add support for circular assignment chains. Implement target history tracking. Create endpoints for retrieving current target information. Add support for target reassignment through special items. Implement the Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) algorithm for optimal target distribution.

# Test Strategy:
Test target assignment with various player counts. Verify reassignment works correctly after eliminations. Test edge cases like last few players and single-player scenarios. Create unit tests for all components of the target assignment system. Implement integration tests to verify the entire target assignment flow. Test API endpoints with different authorization scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Core Target Assignment Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Choose and implement the algorithm (e.g., simple circular chain, random shuffling). Handle initial target assignments when a game starts.
### Details:


## 2. Implement Target Reassignment on Elimination [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: When a kill is verified (integrating with Task 8), update the killer's target to be the victim's target. Handle edge cases (e.g., when the victim was targeting the killer).
### Details:


## 3. Implement Target Data Storage and Retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Update Player model (or create a new TargetAssignment model) to store current target (targetPlayerId). Update PlayerDao (or create TargetAssignmentDao) with methods to update and retrieve target information. Potentially add a field to track assignment history.
### Details:


## 4. Create API Endpoint for Current Target [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a new handler (e.g., TargetHandler) or extend PlayerHandler. Implement a GET endpoint like /players/me/target or /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}/target for players to retrieve their current target. Ensure proper authorization.
### Details:


## 5. (Optional/Future) Implement Target Reassignment via Items [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Design how special items (from Task 10) might affect target assignments (e.g., "Reveal Target", "Change Target"). This might be deferred until Task 10 is implemented.
### Details:


## 6. Create TargetAssignmentService Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement the TargetAssignmentService class that will handle all target assignment logic. This should include methods for initial assignment, reassignment, and target retrieval.
### Details:
The service should implement the algorithms designed in subtask 7.1 and handle all the business logic for target assignments. Consider implementing a game-theoretic approach or the Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) algorithm for optimal assignments.

The TargetAssignmentService has been successfully implemented with comprehensive functionality. The service implements a circular chain assignment algorithm where players are shuffled and assigned targets in a circle, which provides a balanced and fair target distribution. Core features include methods for initial target assignment, target reassignment after player elimination, current target retrieval, and target chain validation.

The implementation includes robust error handling for all scenarios, detailed logging for debugging purposes, and structured data classes (TargetInfo and ValidationResult). The service properly handles edge cases, such as when an eliminated player was targeting their assassin.

From an architectural perspective, the service follows good design principles with clear separation of concerns (extracting target logic from GameService), dependency injection support, and a clean API with well-defined public methods. The service is now ready for integration with GameService and can be utilized by the existing target assignment endpoints.

## 7. Create TargetAssignment Model and DAO [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the TargetAssignment model class and corresponding DAO for database operations.
### Details:
The model should include fields for assignerId, targetId, gameId, assignmentDate, and status. The DAO should provide methods for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting target assignments.
<info added on 2025-06-07T15:19:45.134Z>
The TargetAssignment model has been successfully implemented with comprehensive fields including assignmentId, gameId, assignerId, targetId, assignmentDate, status, assignmentType, previousAssignmentId, completedDate, and notes. The model includes proper DynamoDB annotations with three GSIs for efficient querying, along with convenience methods (isActive(), isCompleted(), markCompleted()) and factory methods (createInitialAssignment(), createReassignment()).

The TargetAssignmentDao has been fully implemented with complete CRUD operations (save, update, delete, findById) and advanced querying capabilities by game/assigner, game/target, and game/status. The DAO utilizes GSIs efficiently and includes comprehensive error handling and logging.

The TargetAssignmentService has been enhanced to integrate with TargetAssignmentDao through dependency injection, providing comprehensive assignment tracking, history, and audit trails. The service maintains backward compatibility with the existing Player-based system while adding detailed logging for audit purposes.

All unit tests and integration tests are passing, confirming the robust implementation of the Target Assignment System with enhanced functionality for assignment history, audit trails, advanced querying, error handling, and scalability for future enhancements.

## 8. Implement Unit Tests for Target Assignment Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.6, 7.7
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all target assignment components including models, DAOs, and services.
### Details:
Tests should cover all edge cases including single player scenarios, last few players, and circular assignments. Use mocking frameworks to isolate components during testing.
<info added on 2025-06-07T13:49:12.856Z>
Integration tests are blocked due to Docker environment requirements. We need to set up Testcontainers to enable proper testing with real DynamoDB instances. Testcontainers will provide isolated, containerized DynamoDB services for our tests, eliminating the need for mocks while ensuring consistent test environments. This approach will allow us to test the TargetAssignment flow with actual database interactions, increasing confidence in our implementation. Once the Docker environment is configured, we can proceed with testing all edge cases as originally planned.

## 9. Implement Integration Tests for Target Assignment Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 7.6, 7.7, 7.8
### Description: Create integration tests that verify the entire target assignment flow from initial assignment to reassignment after eliminations.
### Details:
Tests should simulate game scenarios with multiple players and verify that target assignments are correctly maintained throughout the game lifecycle.
<info added on 2025-06-07T15:07:06.027Z>

- Created proper GSI configurations for GameAssignerIndex, GameTargetIndex, and GameStatusIndex
- Resolved table naming issues between DAOs and test setup
- Implemented proper enhanced client configuration with LocalStack endpoints
