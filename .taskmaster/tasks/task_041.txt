# Task ID: 41
# Title: Develop Large-Scale Game Simulation Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test framework capable of simulating 1000+ concurrent users in an active game environment, with realistic player behaviors, distributed testing capabilities, and performance monitoring.
# Details:
Implement a scalable test framework with the following components:

1. Player Behavior Simulation:
   - Create configurable player profiles with different play patterns (casual, competitive, etc.)
   - Implement state machines to model realistic player actions and decision-making
   - Support for randomized and scripted behavior patterns
   - Include timing variations to simulate human-like interaction patterns

2. Load Testing Infrastructure:
   - Build API endpoint stress testing with parameterized request patterns
   - Implement WebSocket connection pooling and message handling
   - Create mechanisms to gradually scale up user count to identify breaking points
   - Support for maintaining persistent connections over extended test periods

3. Distributed Test Harness:
   - Design a controller system that can orchestrate test agents across multiple regions
   - Implement network latency simulation for different geographic locations
   - Create a synchronization mechanism to coordinate test scenarios across distributed nodes
   - Support Docker containerization for easy deployment of test nodes

4. Metrics Collection and Visualization:
   - Implement real-time data collection for server response times, CPU/memory usage, and network throughput
   - Create a dashboard showing key performance indicators with configurable thresholds
   - Support for historical data comparison between test runs
   - Add export functionality for detailed analysis

5. Failure Testing:
   - Implement chaos testing capabilities (server shutdowns, network partitions)
   - Create scenarios for database failovers and service degradation
   - Test reconnection logic and state recovery mechanisms
   - Validate data consistency during failure events

6. Database Performance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios focusing on database read/write patterns under load
   - Implement query performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
   - Test database scaling mechanisms (sharding, replication)
   - Validate data integrity during high-concurrency operations

The framework should be configurable via YAML or JSON files and include a CLI for running tests with different parameters. All components should be modular to allow for selective testing of specific subsystems.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the test suite implementation through the following approach:

1. Component Testing:
   - Verify each simulation component in isolation with unit tests
   - Validate that player behavior models produce expected action distributions
   - Confirm metrics collection accuracy against known baseline measurements
   - Test that the distributed controller correctly orchestrates test nodes

2. Integration Testing:
   - Run small-scale tests (50-100 users) against a staging environment
   - Verify all metrics are properly collected and visualized
   - Confirm that distributed test nodes properly synchronize
   - Validate that database metrics correctly identify query patterns

3. Validation Testing:
   - Compare results against known benchmarks from production environments
   - Verify that simulated user behavior matches statistical patterns of real users
   - Confirm that performance degradation points match expected system limits
   - Validate that failure recovery mechanisms work as expected

4. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Successfully simulate 1000+ concurrent users across at least 3 geographic regions
   - Dashboard correctly displays real-time performance metrics with less than 5-second delay
   - System can identify performance regression within 10% threshold compared to baseline
   - Database query performance metrics accurately identify slow queries (>100ms)
   - Test suite can run unattended for at least 24 hours without failures
   - Documentation includes examples for creating custom test scenarios
